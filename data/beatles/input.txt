I Saw Her Standing There:

You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Whooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)
Since I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine...

Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

Send her back to me
Cos everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one, lonely one

Send her back to me
Cos everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery (Oh oh oh)

They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows

Gonna mail it to my local D.J.
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
While my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven

Sittin' down by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven

Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just triffle further and reel and rock it

Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do

This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh

If I Fell:

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
Cos I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
Cos I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
Cos I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you

And leave you flat
Because I told you before, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again

No Reply:

This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window

I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
As I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door

I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

I've tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door

I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

No reply, no reply

I'm A Loser:

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Baby's In Black:

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

Oh how long it will take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

Rock And Roll Music:

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I'll Follow The Sun:

One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Some day you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oooh

One day you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

Yea, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you'll know, oooh

One day you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun

Mr. Moonlight:

Mr. Moonlight

I Don't Want To Spoil The Party:

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there

I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad

Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

(Now) And now my life has changed (My life has changed) in oh so many ways
(My independence) My independence seems to vanish in the haze

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind

Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is a night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind

You've Got To Hide Your Love Away:

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

I Need You:

You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me, oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you

But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you
I need you

For I have got another girl, another girl
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do

They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star

The biggest fool that ever hit the big time

It's Only Love:

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you

You Like Me Too Much:

To walk out and make me lonely

I've Just Seen A Face:

I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, da-da-n'da-da'n'da

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I've just seen a face

Me back again
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Oh, falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Yesterday:

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between"

Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I love you

Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown):

I once had a girl
Or should I say
She once had me

She showed me her room
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird had flown

So I lit a fire
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

You Won't See Me:

When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

I don't know why you
Should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't have much to say
But I can't turn away
And you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

Nowhere Man:

He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere Man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command

He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?

Nowhere Man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere Man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command

He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Think For Yourself:

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you

The Word:

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good

Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love

Michelle:

Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that
You'll understand

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do I'm hoping you will
Know what I mean

I love you

I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so
You'll understand

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

I will say the only words I know
That you'll understand, my Michelle

What Goes On:

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

Girl:

Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

Ah, girl, girl, girl

When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

Ah, girl, girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there,
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood.
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ah, girl, girl, girl

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

Ah, girl, girl, girl

I'm Looking Through You:

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

I'm looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Yeah
Oh baby I'm changed
Ah I'm looking through you
Yeah I'm looking through you

In My Life:

There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

In my life I love you more

Wait:

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how, I've been alone

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how, I've been alone

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I've been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I'll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

But if your heart breaks
Don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong
Hold on, I won't delay

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

It's been a long time
Now I'm coming back home
I've been away now
Oh how, I've been alone

If I Needed Someone:

If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah

Run For Your Life:

Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end ah little girl

Well I know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end ah little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end ah little girl

I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end ah little girl
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah (fade out)

Taxman:

(1,2,3,4

Hrmm!

1,2...

1,2,3,4.)

Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

If you drive a car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet

Taxman!
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

Don't ask me what I want it for (Aahh Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more (Aahh Mr. Heath)
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

And you're working for no one but me
Taxman!

Eleanor Rigby:

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?

I'm Only Sleeping:

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Ooh yeah

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

Love You To:

Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins, you'll see

I'll make love to you
If you want me to

Here, There And Everywhere:

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere

Yellow Submarine:

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

{Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain [pronounced bo'sun], full speed ahead!
Full speed it is, Sgt.!
Cut the cable, drop the cable!
Aye, sir, aye!
Captain, captain! [pronounced cap'n, cap'n]}

As we live a life of ease (A life of ease)
Everyone of us (Everyone of us) has all we need (Has all we need)
Sky of blue (Sky of blue) and sea of green (Sea of green)
In our yellow (In our yellow) submarine (Submarine, ha, ha)

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

She Said, She Said:

She said, "I know what it's like to be dead.
I know what it is to be sad."
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

I said, "Who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad.
And you're making me feel like I've never been born."

She said, "You don't understand what I said."
I said, "No, no, no, you're wrong.
When I was a boy everything was right,
Everything was right."

I said, "Even though you know what you know,
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born."

She said, "You don't understand what I said."
I said, "No, no, no, you're wrong.
When I was a boy everything was right,
Everything was right."

I said, "Even though you know what you know,
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born."

She said, "I know what it's like to be dead.
I know what it is to be sad.
I know what it's like to be dead..."

Good Day Sunshine:

Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine

We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine

Then we'd lie beneath the shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.

Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
Good day...

And Your Bird Can Sing:

You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me, you don't get me

You say you've seen Seven Wonders and your bird is green
But you can't see me, you can't see me

When your prized possessions start to weigh you down
Look in my direction, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me, you can't hear me

For No One:

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind her tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind her tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind her tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

Doctor Robert:

Ring my friend, I said you call Doctor Robert
Day or night he'll be there any time at all, Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert, you're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can, Doctor Robert

If you're down he'll pick you up, Doctor Robert
Take a drink from his special cup, Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert, he's a man you must believe
Helping everyone in need
No one can succeed like Doctor Robert

Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you... Doctor Robert

My friend works for the national health, Doctor Robert
Don't pay money just to see yourself with Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert, you're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can, Doctor Robert

Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you... Doctor Robert

Ring my friend, I said you'd call Doctor Robert
Ring my friend, I said you'd call Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert

I Want To Tell You:

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's alright
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time, I've got time, I've got time

Got To Get You Into My Life:

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day?

Tomorrow Never Knows:

Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing...

... that ignorance and hates may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

So play the game "Existence" to the end...
... Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:

It was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely

It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought that you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

With A Little Help From My Friends:

Billy Shears

What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away?
(Does it worry you to be alone?)
How do I feel by the end of the day?
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)
No I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends

(Do you need anybody?)
I need somebody to love
(Could it be anybody?)
I want somebody to love

(Would you believe in a love at first sight?)
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time
(What do you see when you turn out the light?)
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

(Do you need anybody?)
I just need someone to love
(Could it be anybody?)
I want somebody to love

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends

Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds:

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters with looking-glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds [fade out]

Getting Better:

It's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school (No I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Oh), turning me round (Oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Foolish rules)

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get more worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get more worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Ooh)

I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get more worse)
Yes I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
Getting so much better all the time

Fixing A Hole:

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesn't matter if
I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

I'm painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh ooh ooh ah ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

And it really doesn't matter if
I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around
They worry me and never ask me
Why they don't get past my door

I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh ooh ooh ah ah

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
Stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go oh
Where it will go oh

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go (fade out)

She's Leaving Home:

Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband "Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?"

She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years (Bye bye)

She's leaving home
Bye bye

Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!:

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline

The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair, what a scene!

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate

The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late!

Messrs. K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound

And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill!

Within You Without You:

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

When I'm Sixty Four:

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck & Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Ho!

Lovely Rita:

Aaaahhh...

Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid

Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita, maid, ah)
Rita!

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid, Rita meter maid (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Oh Lovely Rita meter meter maid (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Ah da, ah da (Lovely Rita meter maid)

[Leave it.]

Good Morning, Good Morning:

Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street

After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing is changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end

A Day In The Life:

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car;
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy;
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on

Magical Mystery Tour:

Waiting to take you away

Roll up (Satisfaction guaranteed), roll up for the mystery tour
The magical mystery tour is hoping to take you away
Hoping to take you away

The Fool On The Hill:

Day after day, alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Flying:

[Instrumental]

Blue Jay Way:

There's a fog upon L.A.,
And my friends have lost their way.
"We'll be over soon," they said.
Now they've lost themselves instead

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long for I may be asleep

Well, it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long for I may be asleep

Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long for I may be asleep

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long

Your Mother Should Know:

Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (Your mother should...)
Your mother should know (...know)
Sing it again
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born

Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
That was a hit before your mother was born

Your mother should know (Your mother should...)
Your mother should know (...know)
Your mother should know (Your mother should...)
Your mother should know (...know)

I Am The Walrus:

I am he
As you are he
As you are me
And we are all together

See how they run
Like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee shirt
Stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the eggman (Ooh)
They are the eggmen, (Ooh)
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Mister city p'liceman sitting pretty
Little p'licemen in a row
See how they fly
Like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess
Boy you been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the eggman (Ooh)
They are the eggmen (Ooh)
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Sitting in an English
Garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come
You get a tan from standing in the English rain

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob g' goo goo g' joob

Expert texpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile
Like pigs in a sty, see how they snied
I'm crying

Semolina pilchards
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Element'ry penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

I am the eggman (Ooh)
They are the eggmen (Ooh)
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob
Goo goo g' joob
G' goo goo g' joob
Goo goo g' joob, goo goo g' goo g' goo goo g' joob joob

Strawberry Fields Forever:

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Always, no sometimes, think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a "Yes" but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

Penny Lane:

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

Baby, You're A Rich Man:

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are.
What do you want to be?
And have you travelled very far?
Far as the eyes can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby, baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby, baby you're a rich man too (fade out)

The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill:

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes, zap!
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mummy butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

Oh ho!

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

While My Guitar Gently Weeps:

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

Well...

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
[LOVE version:] I look from the wings at the play you are staging.
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
[LOVE version:] As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

Happiness Is A Warm Gun:

She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

Down
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Happiness is a warm gun (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, mama (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
When I hold you in my arms (Oo-oo oh yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (Oo-oo oh yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (Oo-oo oh yeah)

Because happiness is a warm gun, mama (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Well, don't you know that happiness is a warm gun, mama? (Happiness is a warm gun, yeah)

Martha My Dear:

Martha my dear though I spend my days in conversation
Please
Remember me Martha my love
Don't forget me Martha my dear

Hold your head up you silly girl look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Take a good look around you
Take a good look you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other
Silly girl

Hold your hand out you silly girl see what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Martha my dear you have always been my inspiration
Please
Be good to me Martha my love

I'm So Tired:

I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

I'm so tired I don't know what to do
I'm so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

(Monsieur, Monsieur, Monsieur, how about another one?)

Blackbird:

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for the moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life,
You were only waiting for the moment to be free

Black bird fly, black bird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Black bird fly, black bird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Piggies:

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

(One more time...)

Rocky Raccoon:

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn't like that
He said I'm gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner, ah

D'da d'da d'da da da da
D'da d'da d'da da da da
D'da d'da d'da da d'da d'da d'da d'da
Do do do do do do

D'do d'do d'do do do do
D'do d'do d'do do do do
D'do d'do d'do do do d'do d'do d'do d'do
Do do do do do do

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able

And now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival, ah
Oh yeah, yeah

D'do d'do d'do do do do
D'do d'do d'do do do do
D'do d'do d'do do do d'do d'do d'do d'do

D'do d'do d'do do do do, come on, Rocky boy
D'do d'do d'do do do d'do d'do d'do d'do
The story of Rocky there

Don't Pass Me By:

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

I hear the clock are ticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands are moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue

I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

I Will:

Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to, I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will
I will

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
Da da da da da da da

Julia:

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum... calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia

Yes I'm lonely wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

In the morning wanna die
In the evening wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock 'n' roll
Wanna die yeah wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

Mother Nature's Son:

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know you can count me out in
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

Don't you know it's gonna be alright

You say you got a real solution

Honey Pie:

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she's hit the big time
In the USA
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say

Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

Honey pie come back to me, oh

Yeah
I like it like that, oh ah
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, honey, the blues

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me

Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Come, come back to me, honey pie

Oooooooooooh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Honey pie, honey pie

Savoy Truffle:

Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream, nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud

[Instrumental/Solo]

But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now turns so sour
We all know obla-dibla-da
But can you show me where you are?

Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Yes you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cry Baby Cry:

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better

The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the childrens holiday

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local bird and bee

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
Cry baby cry

Cry cry cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

Revolution 9:

(Bottle of Claret for you if I had realised

Well, do it next time.

I forgot about it, George, I'm sorry.
Will you forgive me?

Yes.)

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number

Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a litter slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

Number 9, number 9

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

Number 9, number 9, number 9

People ride, people ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride! Ride!

9, number 9, number 9, number 9

I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen

I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

9, number 9

With the situation

They are standing still

The plan, the telegram

Ooh ooh

Number 9, number

Ooh

A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

Alright!

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the fucking navy and went to sea

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The twist

Eldorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

Maybe even then
Impervious in London
Could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked

If you became naked

Good Night:

Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmm

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Good night, good night, everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night

Yellow Submarine:

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

{Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain [pronounced bo'sun], full speed ahead!
Full speed it is, Sgt.!
Cut the cable, drop the cable!
Aye, sir, aye!
Captain, captain! [pronounced cap'n, cap'n]}

As we live a life of ease (A life of ease)
Everyone of us (Everyone of us) has all we need (Has all we need)
Sky of blue (Sky of blue) and sea of green (Sea of green)
In our yellow (In our yellow) submarine (Submarine, ha, ha)

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Only A Northern Song:

If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that

When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there

And I told you there's no one there

All Together Now:

One, two, three, four
Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, I love you

A, B, C, D
Can I bring my friend to tea?

Hey Bulldog:

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me, if you're lonely you can talk to me

Yeah hey, oh!
Ho, ho!
Yeah!
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho!

Big man (Yeah)
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me, if you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey!

Wahoo woof! Woof!

Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!

[Hey man, what's that noise?

Woof!

Ah ho! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Quiet boy, quiet!

OK.]

Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!

It's All Too Much:

[All too much!]

It's all too much
It's all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much
Ah, it's too much

With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue

You're too much, ah
We all get too much

Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a

Much, much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much, much

Something:

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Maxwell's Silver Hammer:

Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so" oh oh oh
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Do do do do do
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P.C. Thirty-One said "We caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Do do do do do
Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Wow wow wow oh!
Do do do do do

Silver hammer Max

Oh! Darling:

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you, ooh
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me darling

When you told me, ooh
You didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
Oh, believe me darling
Believe me when I tell you, ooh
I'll never do you no harm

Octopus's Garden:

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

I Want You (She's So Heavy):

Here Comes The Sun:

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here 

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
It's all right, it's all right

Because:

Aaaaaahhhhhh...
Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh

Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh

Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue...aaaaaaaahhhh

Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh...
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh...
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh...

You Never Give Me Your Money:

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh...
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh...
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh...

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today (Yes it did)

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel

Mean Mr. Mustard:

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Polythene Pam:

Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World"
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Yeah yeah yeah

She Came In Through The Bathroom Window:

(Gonna come out now,
ha ha ha,
wow look out.)

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah

Golden Slumbers:

Once, there was a way to get back homeward
Once, there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Once, there was a way to get back homeward
Once, there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Carry That Weight:

Boy, you're going to carry that weight,
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

The End:

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

[Drum solo]

[Guitar solos]

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love
You make

Her Majesty:

Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day

I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine

Two Of Us:

["I Dig A Pygmy" by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids. Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats.]

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home 
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home 
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home 
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home 
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[We're going home, you better believe it. Goodbye.]

Dig A Pony:

I dig a pony
Well you can celebrate anything you want
Well you can celebrate anything you want

I do a road hog
Well you can penetrate any place you go
Yes you can penetrate any place you go
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because...

I pick a moon dog
Well you can radiate everything you are
Yes you can radiate everything you are

Oh now
I roll a stoney
Well you can imitate everyone you know
Yes you can imitate everyone you know
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because...

Ooh now
I feel the wind blow
Well you can indicate everything you see
Yes you can indicate everything you see

Oh now
I dug a pony
Well you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah you can syndicate any boat you row
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because...

Across The Universe:

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

I Me Mine:

All through the day, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
All through the night, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day I me mine

I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine, I-I-me-me-mine

All I can hear, I me mine

Even those tears, I me mine

No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day I me mine

I-I-me-me mine, I-I-me-me mine
I-I-me-me mine, I-I-me-me mine

All I can hear, I me mine
I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears, I me mine

No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life I me mine

Dig It:

Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Ah like a rolling stone
Like the FBI and the CIA
And the BBC, BB King
And Doris Day
Matt Busby
Dig it, dig it, dig it
Dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it

[That was "Can You Dig It" by Georgie Wood. And now we'd like to do "Hark The Angels Come".]

Let It Be:

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be

For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be

I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom

One After 909:

My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice

I got my bag, run to the station
railman says you've got the the wrong location

The Long And Winding Road:

The long and winding road, that leads, to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door
The wild and windy night, that the rain, washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way

Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know, the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back, to the long winding road
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to your door

But still they lead me back to the long winding road
You left me standing here, a long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me wait), lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

For You Blue:

(Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members.)

I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment girl for you

(Walk, walk cat walk.
Go, Johnny, go.
Same old the twelve bar blues.

Elmore James got nothing on this baby.)

I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to do

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see your way,
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long

We can work it out

While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long

We can work it out

Paperback Writer:

Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job, so I want to be a paperback writer

And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job but he wants to be a paperback writer

I can change it round and I want to be a paperback writer

Rain:

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes, if the rain comes

When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(when the sun shines down)
And sip their lemonade
(when the sun shines down)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

I can show you that when it starts to rain
(when the rain comes down)
Everything's the same
(when the rain comes down)
I can show you, I can show you

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines
(when it rains and shines)
It's just a state of mind?
(when it rains and shines)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?

Lady Madonna:

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was Heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest?

See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

The Inner Light:

Without going out of my door
I can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of Heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of Heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing

Hey Jude:

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain,
Hey, Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Nah, nah nah, nah nah, nah nah, nah nah

Hey, Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in,
Hey, Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you,
Hey, Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Nah, nah nah, nah nah, nah nah, nah nah yeah

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it better, better, better, better, better... oh!

Revolution:

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait

Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright, al...

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You'd better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

Don't you know know it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

Get Back:

Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jo Jo
Go home

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

Go home
Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Ooh, ooh, get back, Loretta
Your mommy's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back home, Loretta

Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
Oh, get back, get back
Get back, oh, yes

Don't Let Me Down:

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oh, she does, yeah, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oh, she do me, yes, she does

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that had no past (Seeking past)

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

And from the first time that she really done me
Oh, she done me, she done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oh, she done me, she done me good

Don't let me down, hey don't let me down
Heeeee, don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me let down
Can you dig it? Don't let me down

The Ballad Of John And Yoko:

Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it OK
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspapers said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Oh boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you
But your soul, think!"

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspapers said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Caught an early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Old Brown Shoe:

I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours, to miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

Across The Universe:

[birds' tweets]

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer

There will be an answer

Riding On A Bus:

[Speech]

[Brian Matthew:] Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?
[Paul:] We don't think so, really.
[Brian:] You don't ever think that?
[Paul:] Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbing about you, which you get often.
[John:] Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids.
[Brian:] Now, what do you, eh, well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?
[John:] No, she knows I'm not divorced, 'cause I keep seeing her every day, you see.
[Brian:] Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, eh--"
[Paul:] Like riding a bus?
[Brian:] Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--
[Paul:] Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things.
[John:] We go to certain ones.
[George:] And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, 'cause they pretend they don't know us.
[Paul:] Joe's CafAc!
[Brian:] Yeah, that figures.
[Paul:] Joe's CafAc! Social statement, that, you know.
[George:] It is.

You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there

That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Whooh)
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)
Since I saw her standing there

The Honeymoon Song:

I never knew that a day like today lay before us
I've got the sun in my heart and my heart's in the sun
The skys are as bright as your eyes the horizon is open
Love is the ceiling feeling are reeling free as the air

Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but are we who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love

Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but we are who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love

Johnny B. Goode:

Deep down in Louisianna
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B.Goode!

Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
Cos my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge

Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry homedrops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

[Alan:] Are you singing?
[Paul:] Mmm...
[Alan:] Do you have any particular idol that you've ever copied your singing style from?
[John:] What about my book?
[Alan:] John, go away.
[John:] What about my...
[Paul:] Used to be sort of influenced by Elvis in the old days, I think.
[Alan:] Really?
[Paul:] Yeah, used to love him.
[John:] What about my book, then?
[Paul:] Chuck Berry, Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, and, eh, Marvin Gaye and things. Can't really sing like them, you know. I like them, though, love them.
[John:] What about it?
[Alan:] Paul, what about singing "Till There Was You"?

Till There Was You:

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was you

Crinsk Dee Night:

[Speech]

[Brian Matthew:] The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles. In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--
[Paul:] Yes?
[John:] Hey! Listen!
[Paul:] It's all changed, now, Brian. They're not doing that, no actors.
[John:] It's all changed, now.
[Brian:] But this is what I wonder. In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor. Did you find that?
[John:] No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film. You should have seen the rest.
[Brian:] Yes?
[John:] Rubbish!
[Brian:] Was it, really?
[John:] Even worse, yes.
[Brian:] Who was worst?
[John:] Oh, Paul.
[Brian:] I see.
[Paul:] I think John was about the worst.
[John:] No, it was you.
[Paul:] Oh, Ringo was very good. He was. He's a good lad.
[Brian:] He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin. Do you think that's right?
[John:] He was miming.
[Paul:] You, too, with Jason.
[John:] Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?
[Brian:] Beginning to look like that. Now, then--
[Ringo:] All right, John. Can you hear me?
[Paul:] Can you hear him? Hello!
[Brian:] Not really. I hope not. I hope not!
[John:] We brought you the flowers, Ring.
[Brian:] He's not allowed to talk.
[Ringo:] Eh?
[John:] We brought you the flowers.
[Ringo:] Oh, good.
[John:] And the grapes.
[Ringo:] Oh, I like grapes.
[Paul:] He likes grapes.
[George:] We've been to Portugal.
[Brian:] Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then.
[All:] Who?
[Brian:] Los Beatles.
[John:] Los Beatles? Great, great laugh.
[Brian:] I don't suppose you know the title of your film in Portuguese?
[John:] No. Crinsk dee Night?
[Brian:] Could be. Let's hear the number, shall we?
[John:] Right.

A Hard Day's Night:

But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, cos when I get you alone
You know I feel OK

When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog

[John:] What an end!
[Brian:] Quiet! All right, George.
[John:] Fade!
[Brian:] Hold it!
[George:] Oh, thank you.
[John:] Fade, you silly.
[Brian:] Well, we did. We did that. Oh, no! No! We've done that bit!
[John:] The train comes in now.
[Brian:] We did that.
[John:] Yeah.
[Brian:] To prove we weren't playing the record, then, you see. 'Cause, otherwise, there's no point in you being here, is there? Ha, ha, ha!

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
While my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven

Sittin' down by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven

Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just triffle further and reel and rock it

Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle

Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

I get weak in my knees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
My pappie told me
There'd be times like these
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

We meet the gang
And go to rocking Joes
The cats are something
On the heels and toes
I grab my baby
Tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be
Such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees

She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I begged her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some loving, baby
Please please please

Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
And the sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees, yeah

She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I'm begging for her kisses

Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow

She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Rock And Roll Music:

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time

Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cos I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met

Love These Goon Shows!:

[Speech]

[Lee Peters:] But now, John has his work cut out on the next one, as he takes his guitar on and off his neck and pulls the harmonica in and out of his face.

From door to door
The love I crave

You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
Cos I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too

I got to find my baby
I declare there ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever done in my life
Is to find that little woman
Make her my wife

I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Now don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always gonna to be
As sweet as you are

I love you when you're happy

They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always gonna to be
As sweet as you are

Please don't ever change

That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so...

I said we're trav'ling on the one after 909

Roll Over Beethoven:

Well gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local D.J.
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
While my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven
We're rockin' in two by two

Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just triffle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rocking in two by two - Ooo

Well early in the morning
I'm a giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

No Reply:

When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window

I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
As I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door

I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

I've tried to telephone
They said you were not home

Real Love:

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone

It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more it's true
Yes, it is

Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes, it is, it's true
Yes, it is

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes, it is, yes, it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true

You've Got To Hide Your Love Away:

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

If You've Got Trouble:

If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me (Oh oh)

You're quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause you're trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me

I don't think it's funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamond and rings (Oh oh)

You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny
When you know what money can bring

You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two

If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me

You're quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause you're trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me

(Ah rock on, anybody.)

You better leave me alone,
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two

If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me (Oh oh)

You're quite contend to be bad
With all the vantage you had over me
Just cause you're trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
Just cause you're trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me

That Means A Lot:

A friend says that your love
Won't mean a lot
And you know that your love
Is all you've got
At times things are so fine
And at times they're not
But when she says she loves you
That means a lot

A friend says that a love
Is never true
And you know that this
Don't apply on you
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got
When she says she loves you
That means a lot

Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide
What you feel when it's real

A friend says that your love
Won't mean a lot
And you know that your love
Is all you've got
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got
But when she says she loves you
That means a lot

Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah (fade out)

Yesterday:

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

It's Only Love:

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you

Ticket To Ride:

I think I'm gonna be sad

The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride

The next song we'd like to sing...
Shurrup! I'll kill you... is our latest record. Umm yea abop

(When) When I was younger (When I was young) so much younger than today
(I never need) I never needed anybody's help in any way
(Now) But now these days are gone (These days are gone) and I'm not so self assured
(And now I find) Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

(Now) And now my life has changed (My life has changed) in oh so many ways
(My independence) My independence seems to vanish in the haze
(But) But ev'ry now (Every now and then) and then I feel so insecure
(I know that I) I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way

Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby:

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now

Woke up last night, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now

[Instrumental/solo]

Went out last night I didn't stay late
'Fore I got home I had nineteen dates

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now

[Instrumental/solo]

Went out last night I didn't stay late
'fore I got home I had nineteen dates

Everybody's trying to be my baby

Everybody's trying to be my baby now

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby

Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown):

I once had a girl
Or should I say
She once had me

She showed me her room
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird had flown

So I lit a fire
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

I'm Looking Through You:

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

I'm looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Yeah
Oh baby I'm changed
Ah I'm looking through you
Yeah I'm looking through you

Tomorrow Never Knows:

Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing...

... that ignorance and hates may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

So play the game "Existence" to the end...
... Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Got To Get You Into My Life:

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day?

And Your Bird Can Sing:

You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me, you don't get me

You say you've seen Seven Wonders and your bird is green
But you can't see me, you can't see me

When your prized possessions start to weigh you down
Look in my direction, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me, you can't hear me

Taxman:

(1,2,3,4

Hrmm!

1,2...

1,2,3,4.)

Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

If you drive a car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet

Taxman!
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

Don't ask me what I want it for (Aahh Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more (Aahh Mr. Heath)
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

And you're working for no one but me
Taxman!

Eleanor Rigby:

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?

I'm Only Sleeping:

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Ooh yeah

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

Rock And Roll Music:

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

She's A Woman:

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

She don't give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her
She don't give the boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving, don't ask me why

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me love
Forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

She's a woman, she's a woman
She's a woman, she's a woman

Strawberry Fields Forever:

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Always, no sometimes, think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a "Yes" but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

Penny Lane:

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

A Day In The Life:

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car;
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy;
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on

Good Morning, Good Morning:

Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street

After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing is changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

Only A Northern Song:

If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that

When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there

And I told you there's no one there

Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!:

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline

The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair, what a scene!

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate

The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late!

Messrs. K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound

And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill!

Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds:

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters with looking-glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds [fade out]

Within You Without You:

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

I Am The Walrus:

I am he
As you are he
As you are me
And we are all together

See how they run
Like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee shirt
Stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you been a naughty bo
You let your face grow long

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen

Goo goo g' joob

Mister city p'liceman sitting pretty
Little p'licemen in a row
See how they fly
Like Lucy in the sky
See how they run

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess
Boy you been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Sitting in an English
Garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come
You get a tan from standing in the English rain

They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob g' goo goo g' joob

Expert texpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile
Like pigs in a sty, see how they snied
I'm crying

Semolina pilchards
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Element'ry penguin singing Hare Krishna

The Fool On The Hill:

Day after day, alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Lady Madonna:

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was Heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest?

See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

Across The Universe:

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Happiness Is A Warm Gun:

She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

Down
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Happiness is a warm gun (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, mama (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
When I hold you in my arms (Oo-oo oh yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (Oo-oo oh yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (Oo-oo oh yeah)

Because happiness is a warm gun, mama (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun (Happiness bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Well, don't you know that happiness is a warm gun, mama? (Happiness is a warm gun, yeah)

Mean Mr. Mustard:

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Polythene Pam:

Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World"
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Yeah yeah yeah

Glass Onion:

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well here's another place you can be
Listen to me
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Piggies:

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

(One more time...)

Honey Pie:

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she's hit the big time
In the USA
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say

Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

Honey pie come back to me, oh

Yeah
I like it like that, oh ah
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, honey, the blues

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me

Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Come, come back to me, honey pie

Oooooooooooh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Honey pie, honey pie

Don't Pass Me By:

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

I hear the clock are ticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands are moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue

I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
Cause you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry

Cooking breakfast for the queen

Playing piano for the children of the king

So cry baby cry

Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom

And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local bird and bee

Cry baby cry

So cry baby cry

At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
Cry baby cry

Cry cry cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

Blackbird:

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for the moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life,
You were only waiting for the moment to be free

Black bird fly, black bird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Black bird fly, black bird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Sexy Sadie:

She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie

However big you think you are

While My Guitar Gently Weeps:

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

Well...

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
[LOVE version:] I look from the wings at the play you are staging.
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
[LOVE version:] As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

Hey Jude:

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

Rocky Raccoon:

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn't like that
He said I'm gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner, ah

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able

And now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival, ah
Oh yeah, yeah

Step Inside Love / Los Paranoias:

Step inside love and stay
Step inside love

I'm So Tired:

I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

I'm so tired I don't know what to do
I'm so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

(Monsieur, Monsieur, Monsieur, how about another one?)

I Will:

Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to, I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will
I will

Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

She Came In Through The Bathroom Window:

(Gonna come out now,
ha ha ha,
wow look out.)

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah

Well you can radiate everything you are
Yes you can radiate everything you are

Oh now

Well you can imitate everyone you know
Yes you can imitate everyone you know
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because...

Ooh now

Well you can indicate everything you see

Oh now

I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to

Two Of Us:

["I Dig A Pygmy" by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids. Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats.]

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home 
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home 
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home 
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home 
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[We're going home, you better believe it. Goodbye.]

For You Blue:

(Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members.)

Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you

I love you more than ever girl I do
I want you in the morning girl I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment girl for you

(Walk, walk cat walk.
Go, Johnny, go.
Same old the twelve bar blues.

Elmore James got nothing on this baby.)

I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to do
I feel it now I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true
I love you more than ever girl I do

Hold them tight then

Now Ted used to tell her

And he knew he could

The Long And Winding Road:

The long and winding road, that leads, to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door
The wild and windy night, that the rain, washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way

Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know, the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back, to the long winding road
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to your door

But still they lead me back to the long winding road
You left me standing here, a long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me wait), lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh! Darling:

Oh! Darling, please believe me

Believe me when I beg you, ooh

When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me darling

All Things Must Pass:

Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning
But it's not always going to be this grey

All things must pass
All things must pass away

Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving
It has not always been this grey

All things must pass
All things must pass away

All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So I must be on my way
And face another day

Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this grey

All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away

Old Brown Shoe:

I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours, to miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

Octopus's Garden:

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

Maxwell's Silver Hammer:

Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so" oh oh oh
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Do do do do do
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P.C. Thirty-One said "We caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Do do do do do
Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Wow wow wow oh!
Do do do do do

Silver hammer Max

Something:

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Beautiful Delilah, sweet as apple pie
Always gets a second look from fellas passing by
Every time you see her, she's with a different guy
Beautiful Delilah, that's the reason why

Rebecca don't allow me fool around with you
You are so tantalizing, you just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah, dressed in the latest styles
Swinging like a pendulum, walking down the aisle
Sees so many guys, speaks so low and mild
One day she will marry, settle down, after a while

Rebecca don't allow me, fool around with you
You are so tantalizing, you just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah, bathing in the sun
Audience of 17, and noticed not a one
Local Casanova who wouldn't be outdone

You are so tantalizing, you just can't be true

I Gotta Move_EOT

Sometimes I wished I'd stayed at home
Where I'm going no one knows
Only know I gotta go
You gotta move, gotta move
Gotta move, gotta move

I don't wanna get left behind
Gonna love my baby all the time
If I don't wanna get left alone

I gotta move, gotta move
I gotta move, gotta move

Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own

Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own

They said this was the last dance
The lights went dim as I looked round the floor
Then I saw you standing there

The band had started to play
I held you hand and I sighed
Is this the start of another heart breaker
Or something better beginning
Something better beginning
Something better beginning

I never thought I'd love like this until I met you
I found something I thought I'd never had
The only time I feel all right is when I'm with you
I wonder how long it will last

I walked you home in the night
The moon shone bright as we walked hand in hand
I've known this joy once before
But it came to an end just as it had began

Each step that I took with you
Brought one thing closer to my mind
Is this the start of another heart breaker
Or something better beginning
Something better beginning
Something better beginning

Wait Till The Summer Comes Along_EOT
 
I've been cryin' all the Winter.
I've been waiting for some good to come my way,
But I'll wait till the Summer comes along.
Dear Lord, have I done so much wrong.

How can I go on,
Wondering what I did wrong,
Can it be too much to ask?
Please, oh please, let it be.

If the Summer'll come my way,
Will I find someone to take the place of [?]?
But I'll wait till the Summer comes along.
Dear Lord, tell me what could I've done wrong.

Can it be that she,
Never wanted to,
Break some poor mother's heart?
Please, oh please, let it be.

I know my Summer'll never come.
I know I'll cry until my dying day has come.
Let the Winter roll along.
I've got nothing left but song.

Oh, oh, what's happened?
Oh, oh, what's happened?

Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

Rainy Day In June_EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

Holiday In Waikiki_EOT
 
I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,
"I come from New York City,
And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona[?],
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Most Exclusive Residence For Sale_EOT
 
It was the biggest house in the neighborhood.
He went and bought this house when he made good.
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool,
Where he entertained all the people that he knew.
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He went and spent all the money that he had.
Because he had a heart and not a head.
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry.
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury,
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He had to tell all the servants to go away.
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down,
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown.
Then he saw a notice on the wall,
Most exclusive residence for sale.

Fancy_EOT
 
Fancy, if you believe in what I believe in,
Then we'll be the same, always.
Fancy, just look around thee
If you will fancy all the girls you see, always.

My love is like a ruby that no one can see,
Only my fancy, always.
No one can penetrate me,
They only see what's in their own fancy, always.

Little Miss Queen Of Darkness_EOT
 
Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

You're Looking Fine_EOT
 
When I first saw her
She looked alright,
Second time that I saw her
She looked outta sight.
And I said,
You're lookin' fine,

And I feel alright,
Yes, I feel alright.

So directly applied.

And I feel alright,
Yeah, I feel alright.

Sunny Afternoon_EOT
 
The tax man's taken all my dough,
And left me in my stately home,
Lazing on a sunny afternoon.
And I can't sail my yacht,
He's taken everything I've got,
All I've got's this sunny afternoon.

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze.

And I love to live so pleasantly,
Live this life of luxury,
Lazing on a sunny afternoon.

My girlfriend's run off with my car,
And gone back to her ma and pa,
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty.
Now I'm sitting here,
Sipping at my ice cold beer,
Lazing on a sunny afternoon.

Help me, help me, help me sail away,
Well give me two good reasons why I oughta stay.

Live this life of luxury,
Lazing on a sunny afternoon.

Big Black Smoke_EOT
 
She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.

Oh Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs Pleasant?

How are you today?

How's your father, how's your mother?
How's your sister, how's your brother?
How's your brand, new limousine,
Twenty-four inch TV screen?
Did you like prosperity
More than you liked poverty?
Life is easier, so much easier,
Life is easier now.

Oh Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs Pleasant?
Did you know she was flirting around
With another young man,
And he's taking her out
When you have to work late?
And it's not so pleasant after all, hey hey.

This Is Where I Belong_EOT
 
I can't think of a place I'd rather be.
The whole wide world doesn't mean so much to me,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Tell me now if you want me to stay.
It don't matter, 'cause I'd stay here anyway.
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Well, I ain't gonna wander,
Like the boy I used to know.
He's a real unluckly fella,
And he's got no place to go.

I won't search for a house upon a hill.
Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.

Mr. Reporter_EOT
 
Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
I'll believe all that you put down.
I'll believe the sun is going up,
Even though it's going down.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
Don't you twist my words around.
I'll kill you, I won't let you,
Distort my simple sound.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Death Of A Clown_EOT
 
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Two Sisters_EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

No Return_EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Harry Rag_EOT
 
Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold
Tom is as bold as the knights of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's led
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed

Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses herself for the life she's led
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed

Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all
You may take some but you never take it all
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Tin Soldier Man_EOT
 
Just a quiet city sport[?]
With a wife and little kids to support
So immaculately dressed when he walks
Like a soldier on parade

He's a tin soldier man
Living in a little tin wonderland
Very happy little tin soldier man
When you set him on your knee

Every day you see his army march down the street
Changing guards at the high road

He's a tin soldier man

Wickie wa-waddle doo[?]
And he's got a little tin lady too
Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And keep his uniform tidy

Situation Vacant_EOT
 
Suzy and Johnny were happy
Earned enough to pay the rent
But Johnny's mother-in-law had too much ambition
And this made Johnny very upset
So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law
So he left the job where he'd been all his life
He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Then he had to leave the apartment
And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

Lazy Old Sun_EOT
 
Lazy old sun
What have you done to summertime?
Hiding away
Behind all those misty thunder clouds
I don't mind
To spend my time
Looking for you
For you are my one reality
When I'm dead and gone
Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun

Where have all the good times gone?

Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

It's Too Late_EOT
 
It's too late now for you to say your sorry
It's too late now for you to make amends

Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

The wheel of time is grinding 'gainst your dreams
I really wouldn't want to cause no pain now
You said those words, you said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

What's In Store For Me_EOT
 
I wanna know what is to be
To see what life's cut out for me
I'm waiting for my fate
'Cause I know I've done wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I wish I had a crystal ball
To see my rise and see my fall
I've done a lot of right,
But also done some wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And so I'll wait a while
And wait a little longer
I'll just have to wait and see

I think a lot but I'll stop trying
I'll just get old before my time
I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

Too Much On My Mind_EOT
 
There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.

And there is nothing I can do

My poor demented mind is slowly going.

Rainy Day In June_EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

House In The Country_EOT

Holiday In Waikiki_EOT
 
I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,
"I come from New York City,
And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona[?],
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Most Exclusive Residence For Sale_EOT
 
It was the biggest house in the neighborhood.
He went and bought this house when he made good.
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool,
Where he entertained all the people that he knew.
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He went and spent all the money that he had.
Because he had a heart and not a head.
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry.
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury,
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He had to tell all the servants to go away.
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down,
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown.
Then he saw a notice on the wall,

Only my fancy, always.

They only see what's in their own fancy, always.

Little Miss Queen Of Darkness_EOT
 
Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.

For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?

All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Death Of A Clown_EOT
 
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Two Sisters_EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

No Return_EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Harry Rag_EOT
 
Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold
Tom is as bold as the knights of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's led
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed

Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses herself for the life she's led
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed

Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all
You may take some but you never take it all
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Tin Soldier Man_EOT
 
Just a quiet city sport[?]
With a wife and little kids to support
So immaculately dressed when he walks
Like a soldier on parade

He's a tin soldier man
Living in a little tin wonderland
Very happy little tin soldier man
When you set him on your knee

Every day you see his army march down the street
Changing guards at the high road

He's a tin soldier man

Wickie wa-waddle doo[?]
And he's got a little tin lady too
Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And keep his uniform tidy

He's a tin soldier man

Wickie wa-waddle doo[?]
And he's got a little tin lady too
Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And make his uniform tidy

He's a tin soldier man
Living in a little tin wonderland
Very happy little tin soldier man
When you sit him on your knee

He's a tin soldier man
He's a tin soldier man

Situation Vacant_EOT
 
Suzy and Johnny were happy
Earned enough to pay the rent
But Johnny's mother-in-law had too much ambition
And this made Johnny very upset
So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law
So he left the job where he'd been all his life
He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Then he had to leave the apartment
And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

Love Me Till The Sun Shines_EOT
 
You don't have to look at me

When there's someone waiting here
Come on, baby, love me till the sun shines

Two lonely people, the helpless kind[?]
Come on, baby, love me till the sun shines

Lazy Old Sun_EOT
 
Lazy old sun
What have you done to summertime?
Hiding away
Behind all those misty thunder clouds
I don't mind
To spend my time
Looking for you
For you are my one reality
When I'm dead and gone
Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun

Afternoon Tea_EOT

They said that Donna walked away
You'd think at least she might have stayed
To drink her afternoon tea

If you take it with me (afternoon tea)

Gotta Get The First Plane Home_EOT

The World Keeps Going Round_EOT
 
You worry 'bout the sun
What's the use of worrying 'bout the big ol' sun
You worry 'bout the rain
The rain keeps falling just the same
You worry when the one you need has found somebody new

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

You worry 'bout yourself
What's the use of worrying now you're almost grown
You worry 'bout your own
What's the use of worrying 'cause you'll die alone
Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round

You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

I'm On An Island_EOT
 
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to swim
Oh what a mood I am in
I'm on an island

I'm on an island
Since my girl left me behind
She said that I'm not her kind
I'm on an island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me

I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on the island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on this island

I'm on an island

Where Have All The Good Times Gone_EOT
 
Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

It's Too Late_EOT
 
It's too late now for you to say your sorry

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late now for you to sympathize, dear
The wheel of time is grinding 'gainst your dreams
I really wouldn't want to cause no pain now
You said those words, you said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

What's In Store For Me_EOT
 
I wanna know what is to be
To see what life's cut out for me
I'm waiting for my fate
'Cause I know I've done wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I wish I had a crystal ball
To see my rise and see my fall
I've done a lot of right,
But also done some wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And so I'll wait a while
And wait a little longer
I'll just have to wait and see

I think a lot but I'll stop trying
I'll just get old before my time
I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me
I wanna know just what's in store for me

'Round the boutiques of London Town,
Eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends,

And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight,

Tickling their fancy,
Pouring out your charm
To meet your own demands,
And turn it off at will.

And while the cat's away
The mice are gonna play.

And Dandy, you know you can't escape the past.

That two girls are too many, three's a crowd and four you're dead.

Too Much On My Mind_EOT
 
There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.
I'm thinking all the time,
There's too much on my mind,
It seems there's more to life than just to live it.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

My thought just weigh me down,
And drag me to the ground,
And shake my head till there's no more life in me.
It's ruining my brain,
I'll never be the same,
My poor demented mind is slowly going.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

There's too much on my mind.

Rainy Day In June_EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

House In The Country_EOT

From that very day this boy is more than having his share.
One of these days I'm gonna knock him off of his throne,

And a big sports car.
He's gotta house in the country,

Holiday In Waikiki_EOT
 
I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,
"I come from New York City,
And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona[?],
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Most Exclusive Residence For Sale_EOT
 
It was the biggest house in the neighborhood.
He went and bought this house when he made good.
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool,
Where he entertained all the people that he knew.
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He went and spent all the money that he had.
Because he had a heart and not a head.
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry.
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury,
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He had to tell all the servants to go away.
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down,
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown.
Then he saw a notice on the wall,

Fancy_EOT
 
Fancy, if you believe in what I believe in,
Then we'll be the same, always.
Fancy, just look around thee
If you will fancy all the girls you see, always.

My love is like a ruby that no one can see,
Only my fancy, always.
No one can penetrate me,
They only see what's in their own fancy, always.

Little Miss Queen Of Darkness_EOT
 
Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Big Black Smoke_EOT
 
She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.

How's your father, how's your mother?
How's your sister, how's your brother?
How's your brand, new limousine,
Twenty-four inch TV screen?
Did you like prosperity
More than you liked poverty?
Life is easier, so much easier,
Life is easier now.

Oh Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs Pleasant?

With another young man,
And he's taking her out
When you have to work late?

This Is Where I Belong_EOT
 
I can't think of a place I'd rather be.
The whole wide world doesn't mean so much to me,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Tell me now if you want me to stay.
It don't matter, 'cause I'd stay here anyway.
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Well, I ain't gonna wander,
Like the boy I used to know.
He's a real unluckly fella,
And he's got no place to go.

I won't search for a house upon a hill.
Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.

Mr. Reporter_EOT
 
Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
I'll believe all that you put down.
I'll believe the sun is going up,
Even though it's going down.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
Don't you twist my words around.
I'll kill you, I won't let you,
Distort my simple sound.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?

Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Death Of A Clown_EOT
 
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Two Sisters_EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

No Return_EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Harry Rag_EOT
 
Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold
Tom is as bold as the knights of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's led
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed

Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses herself for the life she's led
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed

Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all
You may take some but you never take it all
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Changing guards at the high road

Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And keep his uniform tidy

Situation Vacant_EOT
 
Suzy and Johnny were happy
Earned enough to pay the rent
But Johnny's mother-in-law had too much ambition
And this made Johnny very upset
So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law
So he left the job where he'd been all his life
He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Then he had to leave the apartment
And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

What have you done to summertime?
Hiding away
Behind all those misty thunder clouds
I don't mind
To spend my time
Looking for you
For you are my one reality
When I'm dead and gone
Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun

I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on the island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on this island

I'm on an island

Where Have All The Good Times Gone_EOT
 
Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

It's Too Late_EOT
 
It's too late now for you to say your sorry
It's too late now for you to make amends
You're gonna pay for all the lies you told me
Well don't apologize 'cause it's too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late now for you to sympathize, dear
The wheel of time is grinding 'gainst your dreams
I really wouldn't want to cause no pain now
You said those words, you said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

What's In Store For Me_EOT
 
I wanna know what is to be
To see what life's cut out for me
I'm waiting for my fate
'Cause I know I've done wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I wish I had a crystal ball
To see my rise and see my fall
I've done a lot of right,
But also done some wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And so I'll wait a while
And wait a little longer
I'll just have to wait and see

I think a lot but I'll stop trying
I'll just get old before my time
I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me
I wanna know just what's in store for me

You say you don't understand
But you know you can't win

No need to feel sad now

Too Much On My Mind_EOT
 
There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.

And there is nothing I can do
About it,

And drag me to the ground,
And shake my head till there's no more life in me.

My poor demented mind is slowly going.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.

Rainy Day In June_EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

House In The Country_EOT

Holiday In Waikiki_EOT
 
I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,
"I come from New York City,
And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona[?],
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Most Exclusive Residence For Sale_EOT
 
It was the biggest house in the neighborhood.
He went and bought this house when he made good.
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool,
Where he entertained all the people that he knew.
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He went and spent all the money that he had.
Because he had a heart and not a head.
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry.
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury,
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He had to tell all the servants to go away.
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down,
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown.
Then he saw a notice on the wall,

Only my fancy, always.

Little Miss Queen Of Darkness_EOT
 
Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.

Life is easier, so much easier,
Life is easier now.

For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?

All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

(Wish I could be)
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

He is the head boy at the school
He is the captain of the team
He is so gay and fancy free
And I wish all his money belonged to me
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And all the girls in the neighborhood
Try to go out with David Watts
They try their best but can't succeed
For he is of pure and noble breed

Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

Death Of A Clown_EOT
 
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Two Sisters_EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

No Return_EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Harry Rag_EOT
 
Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold
Tom is as bold as the knights of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's led
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed

Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses herself for the life she's led
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed

Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all
You may take some but you never take it all
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Tin Soldier Man_EOT
 
Just a quiet city sport[?]
With a wife and little kids to support
So immaculately dressed when he walks
Like a soldier on parade

He's a tin soldier man
Living in a little tin wonderland
Very happy little tin soldier man
When you set him on your knee

Every day you see his army march down the street
Changing guards at the high road

He's a tin soldier man

Wickie wa-waddle doo[?]
And he's got a little tin lady too
Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And keep his uniform tidy

He's a tin soldier man

When you sit him on your knee

He's a tin soldier man

Situation Vacant_EOT
 
Suzy and Johnny were happy
Earned enough to pay the rent
But Johnny's mother-in-law had too much ambition
And this made Johnny very upset
So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law
So he left the job where he'd been all his life
He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Then he had to leave the apartment
And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

Lazy Old Sun_EOT
 
Lazy old sun
What have you done to summertime?
Hiding away
Behind all those misty thunder clouds
I don't mind
To spend my time
Looking for you
For you are my one reality
When I'm dead and gone
Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun

The World Keeps Going Round_EOT

You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

You worry 'bout yourself
What's the use of worrying now you're almost grown
You worry 'bout your own
What's the use of worrying 'cause you'll die alone
Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

I'm On An Island_EOT

And I've got no where to swim
Oh what a mood I am in
I'm on an island

I'm on an island
Since my girl left me behind
She said that I'm not her kind
I'm on an island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me

I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on the island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run

Where Have All The Good Times Gone_EOT
 
Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

It's Too Late_EOT

Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late now for you to sympathize, dear
The wheel of time is grinding 'gainst your dreams
I really wouldn't want to cause no pain now
You said those words, you said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

What's In Store For Me_EOT
 
I wanna know what is to be
To see what life's cut out for me

I wanna know just what's in store for me

I wish I had a crystal ball
To see my rise and see my fall
I've done a lot of right,
But also done some wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And so I'll wait a while
And wait a little longer
I'll just have to wait and see

I think a lot but I'll stop trying
I'll just get old before my time
I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight,

Tickling their fancy,
Pouring out your charm
To meet your own demands,

And while the cat's away
The mice are gonna play.

Too Much On My Mind_EOT
 
There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.
I'm thinking all the time,
There's too much on my mind,
It seems there's more to life than just to live it.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

My thought just weigh me down,
And drag me to the ground,
And shake my head till there's no more life in me.
It's ruining my brain,
I'll never be the same,
My poor demented mind is slowly going.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

There's too much on my mind.

Rainy Day In June_EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

House In The Country_EOT

One of these days I'm gonna knock him off of his throne,
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,
And a big sports car.
He's gotta house in the country,
And a big sports car.

And he's oh so smug, oh yeah.

Holiday In Waikiki_EOT
 
I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,
"I come from New York City,
And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona[?],
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Most Exclusive Residence For Sale_EOT
 
It was the biggest house in the neighborhood.
He went and bought this house when he made good.
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool,
Where he entertained all the people that he knew.
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He went and spent all the money that he had.
Because he had a heart and not a head.
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry.
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury,
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He had to tell all the servants to go away.
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down,
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown.
Then he saw a notice on the wall,
Most exclusive residence for sale.

Fancy_EOT
 
Fancy, if you believe in what I believe in,
Then we'll be the same, always.
Fancy, just look around thee
If you will fancy all the girls you see, always.

My love is like a ruby that no one can see,
Only my fancy, always.
No one can penetrate me,
They only see what's in their own fancy, always.

Little Miss Queen Of Darkness_EOT
 
Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Big Black Smoke_EOT
 
She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.

Twenty-four inch TV screen?
Did you like prosperity
More than you liked poverty?
Life is easier, so much easier,
Life is easier now.

Oh Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs Pleasant?

With another young man,
And he's taking her out
When you have to work late?

This Is Where I Belong_EOT
 
I can't think of a place I'd rather be.
The whole wide world doesn't mean so much to me,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Tell me now if you want me to stay.
It don't matter, 'cause I'd stay here anyway.
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Well, I ain't gonna wander,
Like the boy I used to know.
He's a real unluckly fella,
And he's got no place to go.

I won't search for a house upon a hill.
Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,

I'll believe the sun is going up,
Even though it's going down.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
Don't you twist my words around.
I'll kill you, I won't let you,
Distort my simple sound.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?

Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Death Of A Clown_EOT
 
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

Two Sisters_EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

No Return_EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Harry Rag_EOT
 
Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold
Tom is as bold as the knights of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's led
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed

Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses herself for the life she's led
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed

Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all
You may take some but you never take it all
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Situation Vacant_EOT
 
Suzy and Johnny were happy
Earned enough to pay the rent
But Johnny's mother-in-law had too much ambition
And this made Johnny very upset
So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law
So he left the job where he'd been all his life
He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Then he had to leave the apartment
And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

Looking for you
For you are my one reality

Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun

I'm On An Island_EOT
 
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to swim
Oh what a mood I am in
I'm on an island

I'm on an island
Since my girl left me behind
She said that I'm not her kind
I'm on an island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me

I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on the island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on this island

I'm on an island
I'm on an island

Where Have All The Good Times Gone_EOT
 
Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

It's Too Late_EOT
 
It's too late now for you to say your sorry
It's too late now for you to make amends
You're gonna pay for all the lies you told me
Well don't apologize 'cause it's too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late now for you to sympathize, dear
The wheel of time is grinding 'gainst your dreams
I really wouldn't want to cause no pain now
You said those words, you said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

What's In Store For Me_EOT
 
I wanna know what is to be
To see what life's cut out for me
I'm waiting for my fate
'Cause I know I've done wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I wish I had a crystal ball
To see my rise and see my fall
I've done a lot of right,
But also done some wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And so I'll wait a while
And wait a little longer
I'll just have to wait and see

I think a lot but I'll stop trying
I'll just get old before my time
I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me
I wanna know just what's in store for me

You say you don't understand
But you know you can't win

Too Much On My Mind_EOT
 
There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.

And there is nothing I can do

Rainy Day In June_EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

House In The Country_EOT

Holiday In Waikiki_EOT
 
I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,
"I come from New York City,
And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona[?],
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Most Exclusive Residence For Sale_EOT
 
It was the biggest house in the neighborhood.
He went and bought this house when he made good.
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool,
Where he entertained all the people that he knew.
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He went and spent all the money that he had.
Because he had a heart and not a head.
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry.
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury,
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He had to tell all the servants to go away.
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down,
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown.

Only my fancy, always.

Little Miss Queen Of Darkness_EOT
 
Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.

Life is easier, so much easier,
Life is easier now.

For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?

All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

I am a dull and simple lad
Can not tell water from champagne
And I have never met the queen
And I wish I could have all that he has got
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And when I lie on my pillow at night
I dream I could fight like David Watts
Lead the school team to victory
And take my exams and pass the lot

(Wish I could be)
Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be)
Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be)
Conduct my life like David Watts
(Wish I could be)
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

He is the head boy at the school
He is the captain of the team
He is so gay and fancy free
And I wish all his money belonged to me
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And all the girls in the neighborhood
Try to go out with David Watts
They try their best but can't succeed
For he is of pure and noble breed

Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like

Death Of A Clown_EOT
 
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Two Sisters_EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

No Return_EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Harry Rag_EOT
 
Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold
Tom is as bold as the knights of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's led
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed

Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses herself for the life she's led
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed

Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all
You may take some but you never take it all
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Tin Soldier Man_EOT
 
Just a quiet city sport[?]
With a wife and little kids to support
So immaculately dressed when he walks
Like a soldier on parade

He's a tin soldier man
Living in a little tin wonderland
Very happy little tin soldier man
When you set him on your knee

Every day you see his army march down the street
Changing guards at the high road

He's a tin soldier man

Wickie wa-waddle doo[?]
And he's got a little tin lady too
Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And keep his uniform tidy

He's a tin soldier man

When you sit him on your knee

He's a tin soldier man
He's a tin soldier man

Situation Vacant_EOT
 
Suzy and Johnny were happy
Earned enough to pay the rent
But Johnny's mother-in-law had too much ambition
And this made Johnny very upset
So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law
So he left the job where he'd been all his life
He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Then he had to leave the apartment
And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

Love Me Till The Sun Shines_EOT

Lazy Old Sun_EOT
 
Lazy old sun
What have you done to summertime?
Hiding away
Behind all those misty thunder clouds
I don't mind
To spend my time
Looking for you
For you are my one reality
When I'm dead and gone
Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun

Afternoon Tea_EOT

To drink her afternoon tea

If you take it with me (afternoon tea)

The World Keeps Going Round_EOT
 
You worry 'bout the sun
What's the use of worrying 'bout the big ol' sun
You worry 'bout the rain
The rain keeps falling just the same
You worry when the one you need has found somebody new

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

You worry 'bout yourself
What's the use of worrying now you're almost grown
You worry 'bout your own
What's the use of worrying 'cause you'll die alone
Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

I'm On An Island_EOT
 
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to swim
Oh what a mood I am in
I'm on an island

I'm on an island
Since my girl left me behind
She said that I'm not her kind
I'm on an island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me

I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on the island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on this island

Where Have All The Good Times Gone_EOT
 
Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

It's Too Late_EOT
 
It's too late now for you to say your sorry
It's too late now for you to make amends

Well don't apologize 'cause it's too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late now for you to sympathize, dear
The wheel of time is grinding 'gainst your dreams
I really wouldn't want to cause no pain now
You said those words, you said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

What's In Store For Me_EOT
 
I wanna know what is to be
To see what life's cut out for me
I'm waiting for my fate
'Cause I know I've done wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I wish I had a crystal ball
To see my rise and see my fall
I've done a lot of right,
But also done some wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And so I'll wait a while
And wait a little longer
I'll just have to wait and see

I think a lot but I'll stop trying
I'll just get old before my time
I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And when he does his little rounds,
'Round the boutiques of London Town,
Eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends,

And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight,
He feels a dedicated follower of fashion.

In Regent Street and Leicester Square.

Dandy_EOT
 
Dandy, Dandy,
Where you gonna go now?
Who you gonna run to?
All your little life
You're chasing all the girls.
They can't resist your smile.
Oh, they long for Dandy, Dandy.

Checkin' out the ladies,
Tickling their fancy,
Pouring out your charm
To meet your own demands,
And turn it off at will.
Oh, they long for Dandy, Dandy.

Knockin' on the back door,
Climbing through the window,
Hubby's gone away,
And while the cat's away
The mice are gonna play.
Oh, you low down Dandy, Dandy.
Dandy

Dandy, you know you're moving much too fast,
And Dandy, you know you can't escape the past.
Look around you and see the people settle down,
And when you're old and grey you will remember what they said,
That two girls are too many, three's a crowd and four you're dead.

Oh Dandy, Dandy,
When you gonna give up?
Are you feeling old now?
You always will be free,
You need no sympathy,
A bachelor you will stay,

Too Much On My Mind_EOT
 
There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.
I'm thinking all the time,
There's too much on my mind,
It seems there's more to life than just to live it.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

My thought just weigh me down,
And drag me to the ground,
And shake my head till there's no more life in me.
It's ruining my brain,
I'll never be the same,
My poor demented mind is slowly going.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

There's too much on my mind.

Rainy Day In June_EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

House In The Country_EOT
 
He don't need no sedatives to ease his troubled mind.
At work he is invariably unpleasant and unkind.
Why should he care if he is hated in his home,
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,
And a big sports car.
He's gotta house in the country,
And a big sports car.

But he ain't gotta home, oh no,
And he's as wicked as he can be,

Holiday In Waikiki_EOT
 
I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,
"I come from New York City,
And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona[?],
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Most Exclusive Residence For Sale_EOT
 
It was the biggest house in the neighborhood.
He went and bought this house when he made good.
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool,
Where he entertained all the people that he knew.
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He went and spent all the money that he had.
Because he had a heart and not a head.
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry.
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury,
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He had to tell all the servants to go away.
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down,
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown.
Then he saw a notice on the wall,
Most exclusive residence for sale.

Fancy_EOT
 
Fancy, if you believe in what I believe in,
Then we'll be the same, always.
Fancy, just look around thee
If you will fancy all the girls you see, always.

My love is like a ruby that no one can see,
Only my fancy, always.
No one can penetrate me,
They only see what's in their own fancy, always.

Little Miss Queen Of Darkness_EOT
 
Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Big Black Smoke_EOT
 
She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.

Twenty-four inch TV screen?
Did you like prosperity
More than you liked poverty?
Life is easier, so much easier,
Life is easier now.

Oh Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs Pleasant?

With another young man,
And he's taking her out
When you have to work late?

This Is Where I Belong_EOT
 
I can't think of a place I'd rather be.
The whole wide world doesn't mean so much to me,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Tell me now if you want me to stay.
It don't matter, 'cause I'd stay here anyway.
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Well, I ain't gonna wander,
Like the boy I used to know.
He's a real unluckly fella,
And he's got no place to go.

I won't search for a house upon a hill.
Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,

I'll believe the sun is going up,
Even though it's going down.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
Don't you twist my words around.
I'll kill you, I won't let you,
Distort my simple sound.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?

Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Death Of A Clown_EOT
 
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

Two Sisters_EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

No Return_EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Harry Rag_EOT
 
Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold
Tom is as bold as the knights of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's led
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed

Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses herself for the life she's led
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed

Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all
You may take some but you never take it all
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Situation Vacant_EOT
 
Suzy and Johnny were happy
Earned enough to pay the rent
But Johnny's mother-in-law had too much ambition
And this made Johnny very upset
So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law
So he left the job where he'd been all his life
He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Then he had to leave the apartment
And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

Looking for you
For you are my one reality

Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun

The World Keeps Going Round_EOT
 
You worry 'bout the sun
What's the use of worrying 'bout the big ol' sun
You worry 'bout the rain
The rain keeps falling just the same
You worry when the one you need has found somebody new

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

You worry 'bout yourself
What's the use of worrying now you're almost grown
You worry 'bout your own
What's the use of worrying 'cause you'll die alone
Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round

Times will be hard, rain will fall
And you'll feel mighty low

But the world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
The world keeps going round
You just can't stop it
The world keeps going round
The world keeps going round

I'm On An Island_EOT
 
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to swim
Oh what a mood I am in
I'm on an island

I'm on an island
Since my girl left me behind
She said that I'm not her kind
I'm on an island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me

I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on the island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me
I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on this island

I'm on an island
I'm on an island

Where Have All The Good Times Gone_EOT
 
Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

It's Too Late_EOT
 
It's too late now for you to say your sorry
It's too late now for you to make amends

Well don't apologize 'cause it's too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late now for you to sympathize, dear
The wheel of time is grinding 'gainst your dreams
I really wouldn't want to cause no pain now
You said those words, you said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

What's In Store For Me_EOT
 
I wanna know what is to be
To see what life's cut out for me
I'm waiting for my fate
'Cause I know I've done wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I wish I had a crystal ball
To see my rise and see my fall
I've done a lot of right,
But also done some wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And so I'll wait a while
And wait a little longer
I'll just have to wait and see

I think a lot but I'll stop trying
I'll just get old before my time
I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me
I wanna know just what's in store for me

Too Much On My Mind_EOT
 
There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.

And there is nothing I can do

Rainy Day In June_EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

Holiday In Waikiki_EOT
 
I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,
"I come from New York City,
And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona[?],
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Most Exclusive Residence For Sale_EOT
 
It was the biggest house in the neighborhood.
He went and bought this house when he made good.
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool,
Where he entertained all the people that he knew.
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He went and spent all the money that he had.
Because he had a heart and not a head.
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry.
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury,
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He had to tell all the servants to go away.
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down,
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown.

Only my fancy, always.

Little Miss Queen Of Darkness_EOT
 
Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness

A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.

Looking for her child in the big black smoke,

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

David Watts_EOT
 
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

I am a dull and simple lad
Can not tell water from champagne
And I have never met the queen
And I wish I could have all that he has got
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And when I lie on my pillow at night
I dream I could fight like David Watts
Lead the school team to victory
And take my exams and pass the lot

(Wish I could be)
Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be)
Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be)
Conduct my life like David Watts
(Wish I could be)
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

He is the head boy at the school
He is the captain of the team
He is so gay and fancy free
And I wish all his money belonged to me
I wish I could be like David Watts

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

And all the girls in the neighborhood
Try to go out with David Watts
They try their best but can't succeed
For he is of pure and noble breed

Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like

Death Of A Clown_EOT
 
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Two Sisters_EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

No Return_EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Harry Rag_EOT
 
Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold
Tom is as bold as the knights of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's led
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed

Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses herself for the life she's led
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed

Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all
You may take some but you never take it all
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Tin Soldier Man_EOT
 
Just a quiet city sport[?]
With a wife and little kids to support
So immaculately dressed when he walks
Like a soldier on parade

He's a tin soldier man
Living in a little tin wonderland
Very happy little tin soldier man
When you set him on your knee

Every day you see his army march down the street
Changing guards at the high road

He's a tin soldier man

Wickie wa-waddle doo[?]
And he's got a little tin lady too
Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And keep his uniform tidy

He's a tin soldier man

Situation Vacant_EOT
 
Suzy and Johnny were happy
Earned enough to pay the rent
But Johnny's mother-in-law had too much ambition
And this made Johnny very upset
So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law
So he left the job where he'd been all his life
He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Then he had to leave the apartment
And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

Lazy Old Sun_EOT
 
Lazy old sun
What have you done to summertime?
Hiding away
Behind all those misty thunder clouds
I don't mind
To spend my time
Looking for you
For you are my one reality
When I'm dead and gone
Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun

And I've got no where to swim
Oh what a mood I am in

I'm on an island
Since my girl left me behind
She said that I'm not her kind
I'm on an island

But there is no where else on Earth I'd rather be
Then if my long, lost little girl was here with me

I'm on an island
And I've got no where to run
Because I'm the only one
Who's on the island

Where Have All The Good Times Gone_EOT
 
Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys

Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?

It's Too Late_EOT

Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

It's too late
Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

The wheel of time is grinding 'gainst your dreams
I really wouldn't want to cause no pain now
You said those words, you said them much too late

Much too late
You said those words
You said them much too late

To see my rise and see my fall
I've done a lot of right,
But also done some wrong
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And so I'll wait a while
And wait a little longer
I'll just have to wait and see

I think a lot but I'll stop trying
I'll just get old before my time
I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

I'll live the life I've got
But I don't sleep at night
I wanna know just what's in store for me

And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight,

Who you gonna run to?
All your little life
You're chasing all the girls.
They can't resist your smile.
Oh, they long for Dandy, Dandy.

Checkin' out the ladies,
Tickling their fancy,
Pouring out your charm
To meet your own demands,
And turn it off at will.
Oh, they long for Dandy, Dandy.

Climbing through the window,
Hubby's gone away,
And while the cat's away
The mice are gonna play.
Oh, you low down Dandy, Dandy.

Dandy, you know you're moving much too fast,
And Dandy, you know you can't escape the past.
Look around you and see the people settle down,
And when you're old and grey you will remember what they said,
That two girls are too many, three's a crowd and four you're dead.

Oh Dandy, Dandy,
When you gonna give up?
Are you feeling old now?
You always will be free,
You need no sympathy,
A bachelor you will stay,

You're all right.

Too Much On My Mind_EOT
 
There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.
I'm thinking all the time,
There's too much on my mind,
It seems there's more to life than just to live it.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

My thought just weigh me down,
And drag me to the ground,
And shake my head till there's no more life in me.
It's ruining my brain,
I'll never be the same,
My poor demented mind is slowly going.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

There's too much on my mind.

Rainy Day In June_EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

House In The Country_EOT
 
He don't need no sedatives to ease his troubled mind.
At work he is invariably unpleasant and unkind.
Why should he care if he is hated in his home,
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,
And a big sports car.
He's gotta house in the country,
And a big sports car.

But he ain't gotta home, oh no,
And he's as wicked as he can be,
'Cause he's gotta house in the country
Where he likes to spend his weekend days.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well all right

Well, he got his job when drunken Daddy tumbled down the stairs.
From that very day this boy is more than having his share.

Holiday In Waikiki_EOT
 
I won a competition in a little column in my local paper.
So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

I didn't realize it was commercialized when I unpacked my cases,
Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.
I asked her where she came from and she said to me,
"I come from New York City,
And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.

It's a hooka hooka on the shiny briny on the way to Kona[?],
And in a little shack they had a little sign that said Coca Cola,
And even all the grass skirts were PVC.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Most Exclusive Residence For Sale_EOT
 
It was the biggest house in the neighborhood.
He went and bought this house when he made good.
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool,
Where he entertained all the people that he knew.
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He went and spent all the money that he had.
Because he had a heart and not a head.
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry.
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury,
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.
Most exclusive residence for sale.

He had to tell all the servants to go away.
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down,
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown.
Then he saw a notice on the wall,
Most exclusive residence for sale.

Fancy_EOT
 
Fancy, if you believe in what I believe in,
Then we'll be the same, always.
Fancy, just look around thee
If you will fancy all the girls you see, always.

Only my fancy, always.
No one can penetrate me,
They only see what's in their own fancy, always.

Little Miss Queen Of Darkness_EOT
 
Well I met her accidentally,
In a little discotheque.
And she acted oh so friendly
To every fella that she met.
And her hair was hanging down,
Like a bright and silken sheen.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing night and day.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

Although she looked so happy,
There was sadness in her eyes.
And her curly false eyelashes
Weren't much of a disguise.
And her bright and golden hair,
Was not all that it might seem.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dances sadly on.
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.
'Cause the only boy she had
Went and coolly stepped aside.
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Might as well have died.
Little Miss Queen of Darkness
Dancing, dancing on.

And left me in my stately home,
Lazing on a sunny afternoon.

Big Black Smoke_EOT
 
She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.

Twenty-four inch TV screen?
Did you like prosperity
More than you liked poverty?
Life is easier, so much easier,
Life is easier now.

Oh Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs Pleasant?
Did you know she was flirting around
With another young man,
And he's taking her out
When you have to work late?

This Is Where I Belong_EOT
 
I can't think of a place I'd rather be.
The whole wide world doesn't mean so much to me,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Tell me now if you want me to stay.
It don't matter, 'cause I'd stay here anyway.
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Well, I ain't gonna wander,
Like the boy I used to know.
He's a real unluckly fella,
And he's got no place to go.

I won't search for a house upon a hill.
Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.

Mr. Reporter_EOT
 
Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,

I'll believe the sun is going up,
Even though it's going down.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
Don't you twist my words around.
I'll kill you, I won't let you,
Distort my simple sound.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Death Of A Clown_EOT
 
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Two Sisters_EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

No Return_EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Harry Rag_EOT
 
Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold
Tom is as bold as the knights of old
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And he curses himself for the life he's led
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed

Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And she curses herself for the life she's led
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed

Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all
You may take some but you never take it all
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Changing guards at the high road

Situation Vacant_EOT
 
Suzy and Johnny were happy
Earned enough to pay the rent
But Johnny's mother-in-law had too much ambition
And this made Johnny very upset
So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law
So he left the job where he'd been all his life
He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Then he had to leave the apartment
And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

Lazy old sun
What have you done to summertime?
Hiding away
Behind all those misty thunder clouds
I don't mind
To spend my time
Looking for you
For you are my one reality
When I'm dead and gone
Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun

Do You Remember Walter?_EOT
 
Walter, remember when the world was young
And all the girls knew Walter's name?
Walter, isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed?
Do you remember, Walter, playing cricket in the thunder and the rain?
Do you remember, Walter, smoking cigarettes behind your garden gate?
Yes, Walter was my mate,
But Walter, my old friend, where are you now?

Walter's name.
Walter, isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed?
Do you remember, Walter, how we said we'd fight the world so we'd be free.
We'd save up all our money and we'd buy a boat and sail away to sea.
But it was not to be.
I knew you then but do I know you now?

Walter, you are just an echo of a world I knew so long ago
If you saw me now you wouldn't even know my name.
I bet you're fat and married and you're always home in bed by half-past eight.
And if I talked about the old times you'd get bored and you'll have nothing more to say.
Yes people often change, but memories of people can remain.

Picture Book_EOT
 
Picture yourself when you're getting old,
Sat by the fireside a-pondering on[?].
Picture book, pictures of your mama, taken by your papa a long time ago.
Picture book, of people with each other, to prove they love each other a long ago.
Na, na, na, na, na na.

A picture of you in your birthday suit,
You sat in the sun on a hot afternoon.
Picture book, your mama and your papa, and fat old Uncle Charlie out boozing with their friends.
Picture book, a holiday in August, outside a bed and breakfast in sunny Southend.
Picture book, when you were just a baby, those days when you were happy, a long time ago.

Johnny Thunder_EOT
 
Johnny Thunder lives on water, feeds on lightning.
Johnny Thunder don't need no one, don't want money.
And all the people of the town,
They can't get through to Johnny, they will never, ever break him down.
Johnny Thunder speaks for no one, goes on fighting.
And sweet Helena in bed[?] prays for Johnny.

Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Thunder and lightning.
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Thunder and lightning.

Though everybody tried their best,
Old Johnny vowed that he would never, ever end up like the rest.
Johnny Thunder rides the highway, moves like lightning.
But sweet Helena just says, "God bless Johnny."

Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Thunder and lightning.
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Ba ba-ba ba ba-ba ba,
Thunder and lightning.

Last Of The Steam-Powered Trains_EOT
 
Like the last of the good ol' puffer trains,
I'm the last of the blood and sweat brigade,
And I don't know where I'm going, or why I came.
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.

I'm the last of the good old renegades.
All my friends are all middle class and grey,
But I live in a museum, so I'm okay.
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.

Like the last of the good ol' choo-choo trains,
Huff and puff 'till I blow this world away,
And I'm gonna keep on rollin' till my dying day.
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.

Like the last of the good ol' puffer trains,
I'm the last of the soot and scum[?] brigade,
And all this peaceful living is drivin' me insane.
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.

Big Sky_EOT
 
Big Sky looked down on all the people looking up at the Big Sky.
Everybody pushing one another around
Big Sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry
But the Big Sky's too big to let it get him down.

Big Sky too big to cry
Big Sky too high to see
People like you and me

One day we'll be free, we won't care, just you see
'Til that day can be, don't let it get you down
When I feel that the world is too much for me
I think of the Big Sky, and nothing matters much to me.

Big Sky looked down on all the people who think they got problems
They get depressed and they hold their head in their hands and cry.
People lift up their hands and they look up to the Big Sky
But Big Sky is too big to sympathize

Big Sky's too occupied
Though he would like to try
And he feels bad inside
Big Sky's too big to cry

One day we'll be free, we won't care, just you wait and see
'Til that day can be, don't let it get you down.
When I feel that the world is too much for me
I think of the Big Sky, and nothing matters much to me.

Sitting By The Riverside_EOT
 
Just sitting down by the riverside,
Spreading my arms to the open wide.
Now I am free and the world's at my feet.
I can close my eyes.

Oh Love, keep me warm, keep me satisfied.
Please keep me calm, keep me pacified.
Now I'm content and my life is complete.
I can close my eyes.

Sitting by the riverside with you.

I love sitting down by the riverside,
Watching the water go flowing by.
Oh, golly gee, it is heaven to be
Like a willow tree.

Spend my time just drinking wine while looking at the view.

Animal Farm_EOT
 
This world is big and wild and half insane
Take me where real animals are playing
Just a dirty old shack
Where the hound dogs bark
That we called our home
I want to be back there
Among the cats and dogs
And the pigs and the goats
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home

While I lay my head upon my pillow
Little girl, come play beneath my window
Though she's far from home
She is free from harm
And she need not fear
She is by my side
And the sky is wide
So let the sun shine bright
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home

Girl, It's a hard, hard world, if it gets you down
Dreams often fade and die in a bad, bad world
I'll take you where real animals are playing
And people are real people not just playing
It's a quiet, quiet life
By a dirty old shack
That we called our home
I want to be back there
Among the cats and dogs
And the pigs and the goats
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
Animal Farm

Village Green_EOT
 
Out in the country,
Far from all the soot and noise of the city,
There's a village green.
It's been a long time
Since I last set eyes on the church with the steeple
Down by the village green.
'Twas there I met a girl called Daisy
And kissed her by the old oak tree.
Although I loved my Daisy, I saw fame,
And so I left the village green.

I miss the village green,
And all the simple people.
I miss the village green,
The church, the clock, the steeple.
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.

And now all the houses
Are rare antiquities.
American tourists flock to see the village green.
They snap their photographs and say "Gawd darn it,
Isn't it a pretty scene?"
And Daisy's married Tom the grocer boy,
And now he owns a grocery.

I miss the village green,
And all the simple people.
I miss the village green,
The church, the clock, the steeple.
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.

And I will return there,
And I'll and Daisy,
And we'll sip tea, laugh,
And talk about the village green.
We will laugh and talk about the village green.

Starstruck_EOT
 
Baby, you don't know what you're saying,
Because you're a victim of bright city lights,
And your mind is not right.
You think the world's at your feet.

'Cause you're starstruck, baby, starstruck.
Taken in by the lights,
Think you'll never look back,
You know you're starstruck on me.

Baby, you're running around like you're crazy.
You go to a party and dance through the night,
And you'll drink 'till you're tight,
And then you're out on your feet.

'Cause you're starstruck, baby, starstruck.
Taken in by the lights,
Think you'll never look back,
You know you're starstruck on me.

Baby, watch out or else you'll be ruined,
'Cause once you're addicted to wine and champagne,
It's gonna drive you insane,
Because the world's not so tame.

And you're starstruck, baby, starstruck.
You're taken in by the lights,
Think you'll never look back,
You know you're starstruck on me.
Don't you know that you are,
Starstruck on me.
And you always will be,
Starstruck on me.
Starstruck on me.

Phenomenal Cat_EOT
 
A long, long time ago,
In the land of idiot boys,
There live a cat, a phenomenal cat,
Who loved to wallow all day.

No one bothered him
As he sat, content in his tree.
He just lived to eat 'cause it kept him fat,
And that's how he wanted to stay.

Though he was big and fat,
All the world was good to him,
And he pointed out on the map
All the places he had been.
[Cowes, Cathage,Karthom,Cannes?], [India,Sardinia?], Kathmandu,
The Scilley Isles and Sahara, too

Fum, fum, diddle-um di
La la la la, la-la la la
La la la la, la-la la la la
La la la la-la la la

Once when he was thin
He had flown to old Hong Kong,
And had learned the secret of life,
And the sea and the sky beyond.
So he gave up his diet and sat in a tree,
And ate himself through eternity.

Fum, fum, diddle-um di
La la la la la-la la la
La la la la, la-la la la la
La la la la-la la la
Fum, fum, diddle-um di
Fum, fum, diddle-um di

All Of My Friends Were There_EOT
 
My big day, it was the biggest day of my life.
It was the summit of my long career,
But I felt so down, and I drank too much beer,
The management said that I shouldn't appear.
I walked out onto the stage and started to speak.
The first night I've missed for a couple of years,
I explained to the crowed and they started to jeer,
And just when I wanted no one to be there,
All of my friends were there.
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.
All of my friends were there to stand and stare,
Say what they may, all of their friends need not stay.
Those who laughed were not friends anyway.
All of my friends were there to stand and stare.

Days went by, I walked around dressed in a disguise.
I wore a mustache and I parted my hair,
And gave the impression that I did not care,
But oh, the embarrassment, oh, the dispair.
Came the day, helped with a few large glasses of gin,
I nervously mounted the stage once again,
Got through my performance and no one complained,
Thank God I can go back to normal again.
I went to that old cafe,
Where I had been in much happier days,
And all of my friends were there,
And no one cared.
Say what they may, all of my friends were there.
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.
All of my friends were there,
Now I don't care.

Wicked Annabella_EOT
 
In a dark and misty house,
Where no Christian man has been,
Wicked Annabella mixes a brew
That no one's ever seen.

Relatives have passed her by,
Too scared to even say hello.
She's in perpetual midnight,
She shuts out the day,
And goes about her sinful ways.

I, I've seen her hair, I've seen her face,
Look towards mine.
I, I've felt her eyes burning my sole,
Twisting my mind.

Little children who are good
Should always go to sleep at night,
'Cause Wicked Annabella is up in the sky
Hopin' they will open their eyes.

Don't go into woods tonight,
'Cause underneath the sticks and stones
Are lots of little demons enslaved by Annabella
Waiting just to carry you home

Monica_EOT
 
Under a lamp light
Monica stands at midnight,
And every guy think he can buy her love,
But money can't buy sweet lovin' from Monica.

Morning to moonshine,
Monica knows every line.
Don't ever propose 'cause Monica knows, you know.
She'll turn up her nose and say what a fool you are.

I, I shall die,
I, I shall die if I should lose Monica.
(Oh Monica my love.)
People can try,
People can try, but they can't buy Monica, my love.

You take the sunshine,
I'll take the nightly shadows.
'Cause everyone knows that Monica glows at night.
She'll do something wrong and prove to you she is right.

I, I shall die,
I, I shall die if I should lose Monica.
(Oh Monica my love.)
People may try,
People may try, but they can't buy Monica, my love.

Morning to moonshine,
Monica knows every line.
Don't ever propose 'cause Monica knows, you know.
She'll turn up her nose and say what a fool you are.
Monica.

People Take Pictures Of Each Other_EOT
 
People take pictures of the Summer,
Just in case someone thought they had missed it,
And to proved that it really existed.
Fathers take pictures of the mothers,
And the sisters take pictures of brothers,
Just to show that they love one another.

You can't picture love that you took from me,
When we were young and the world was free.
Pictures of things as they used to be,
Don't show me no more, please.

People take pictures of each other,
Just to prove that they really existed,
Just to prove that they really existed.
People take pictures of each other,
And the moment to last them for ever,
Of the time when they mattered to someone.

People take pictures of the Summer,
Just in case someone thought they had missed it,
Just to proved that it really existed.
People take pictures of each other,
And the moment to last them for ever,
Of the time when they mattered to someone.
Picture of me when I was just three,
Sucking my thumb by the old oak tree.
Oh how I love things as they used to be,
Don't show me no more, please.

Thank you for the days,
Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me.

I bless the light,
I bless the light that lights on you believe me.
And though you're gone,
You're with me every single day, believe me.

Days I'll remember all my life,
Days when you can't see wrong from right.
You took my life,
But then I knew that very soon you'd leave me,
But it's all right,
Now I'm not frightened of this world, believe me.

I wish today could be tomorrow,
The night is dark,
It just brings sorrow anyway.

Victoria_EOT
 
Long ago life was clean
Sex was bad and obscene
And the rich were so mean
Stately homes for the Lords
Croquet lawns, village greens
Victoria was my queen
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria

I was born, lucky me
In a land that I love
Though I am poor, I am free
When I grow I shall fight
For this land I shall die
Let her sun never set
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, toria

Land of hope and gloria
Land of my Victoria
Land of hope and gloria
Land of my Victoria
Victoria, 'toria

Canada to India
Australia to Cornwall
Singapore to Hong Kong
From the West to the East
From the rich to the poor
Victoria loved them all

So you think that you've got ambition
Stop your dreaming and your idle wishing
You're outside and there ain't no admission

Everything Is in its place
Authority must be maintained
And then we know exactly where we are
Let them feel that they're important to the cause
But let them know that they are fighting for their homes
Just be sure that they're contributing their all
Give the scum a gun and make the bugger fight
And be sure to have deserters shot on sight
If he dies we'll send a medal to his wife

Yes Sir, no Sir
Please let me die Sir
I think this life is affecting my brain
Yes Sir, no Sir
Three bags full Sir
What do I do Sir, what do I say
What do I say, how do I behave, what do I say

Some Mother's Son_EOT
 
Some mother's son lies in a field
Someone has killed some mother's son today
Head blown up by some soldier's gun
While all the mothers stand and wait
Some mother's son ain't coming home today
Some mothers son ain't got no grave

Two soldiers fighting in a trench
One soldier glances up to see the sun
And dreams of games he played when he was young
And then his friend calls out his name
It stops his dream and as he turns his head
A second later he is dead

Some mother's son lies in a field
Back home they put his picture in a frame
But all dead soldiers look the same
While all the parents stand and wait
To meet their children coming home from school
Some mother's son is lying dead

Somewhere someone is crying
Someone is trying to be so brave
But still the world keeps turning
Though all the children have gone away

Some mother's son lies in a field
But in his mother's eyes he looks the same
As on the day he went away

They put his picture on the wall
They put flowers in the picture frame
Some mothers memory remains

Drivin'_EOT
 
It seems like all the world is fighting
They're even talking of a war
Let all the Russians and the Chinese
And the Spanish do their fighting
The sun is shining
We're going drivin', drivin'

Drop all your work
Leave it behind
Forget all your problems
And get in my car
And take a drive with me

The sandwiches are packed
The tea is in the flask
We've plenty of beer
And gooseberry tarts
So take a drive with me

We'll take your mother if you want to
We'll have a picnic on the grass
Forget your nephews
And your cousins and your brothers and your sisters
They'll never miss us
'Cos we'll be drivin', drivin'. drivin'. drivin'

Thousands of trees
Hundreds of fields
Millions of birds
So why don't you come
And take a drive with me

We'll talk to the cows
And laugh at the sheep
We'll lie in a field
And we'll have a sleep
So take a drive with me

And all the troubled world around us
Seems an eternity away
And all the debt collectors
Rent collectors
All will be behind us
But they'll never find us
'Cos we'll be drivin', drivin', drivin', drivin'

Passed Barnet Church
Up to Potters Bar
We won't be home late
It's not very far
So take a drive with me, take a drive with me
Drivin', drivin', drivin', drivin'

Brainwashed_EOT
 
You look like a real human being
But you don't have a mind of your own
Yeah, you can talk, you can breathe
You can work, you can stitch, you can sew
But you're brainwashed
Yes you are, yes you are

And a wife, and your kids and a car
Yeah, you're conditioned to be

Get down on your knees
Get down on your knees

The aristocrats and bureaucrats
Are dirty rats
For making you what you are
They're up there and you re down here
You're on the ground and they're up with the stars
All your life they've kicked you around and pushed you around
Till you can't take any more
To them you're just a speck of dirt
But you don't want to get up off the floor
Mister you're just brainwashed
They give you social security
Tax saving benefits that grow at maturity
Yeah, you're conditioned to be
What they want you to be
And to do what they want you to
Yes you are, yes you are
Get down on your knees

Shangri-La_EOT
 
Now that you've found your paradise
This is your Kingdom to command
You can go outside and polish your car
Or sit by the fire in your Shangri-la
Here is your reward for working so hard
Gone are the lavatories in the back yard
Gone are the days when you dreamed of that car
You just want to sit in your Shangri-la

Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
You've reached your top and you just can't get any higher
You're in your place and you know where you are
In your Shangri-la
Sit back in your old rocking chair
You need not worry, you need not care
You can't go anywhere
Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la

The little man who gets the train
Got a mortgage hanging over his head
But he's too scared to complain
'Cos he's conditioned that way
Time goes by and he pays off his debts
Got a TV set and a radio
For seven shillings a week
Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la, Shangri-la

And all the houses in the street have got a name
'Cos all the houses in the street they look the same
Same chimney pots, same little cars, same window panes
The neighbors call to tell you things that you should know
They say their lines, they drink their tea, and then they go
They tell your business in another Shangri-la
The gas bills and the water rates, and payments on the car
Too scared to think about how insecure you are
Life ain't so happy in your little Shangri-la
Shangri-la, Shangri-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
You've reached your top and you just can't get any higher
You're in your place and you know where you are
In your Shangri-la
Sit back in your old rocking chair
You need not worry, you need not care
You can't go anywhere

Mr. Churchill Says_EOT
 
Well Mr. Churchill says, Mr. Churchill says
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end
Mr. Beaverbrook says we gotta save our tin
And all the garden gates
And empty cans are gonna make us win

We shall defend our island
On the land and on the sea
We shall fight them on the beaches
On the hills and in the fields
We shall fight them in the streets
Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed to so few
'Cos they have made our British Empire
A better place for me and you
And this was their finest hour
Well Mr. Montgomery says
And Mr. Mountbatten says
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end
As Vera Lynn would say
We'll meet again someday
But all the sacrifices we must make before the end

Did you hear that plane flying overhead
There's a house an fire and there's someone lying dead
We gotta clean up the streets
And get me back on my feet
Because we wanna be free
Do your worst and we'll do our best
We're gonna win the way that Mr. Churchill says
Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! Well Mr. Churchill says
We gotta hold up our chins
We gotta show some courage and some discipline
We gotta black up the windows and nail up the doors
And keep right on till the end of the war

She's Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina_EOT
 
She's bought a hat like Princess Marina's
To wear at all her social affairs
She wears it when she's cleaning the windows
She wears it when she's scrubbing the stairs
But you will never see her at Ascot
She can't afford the time or the fare
But she's bought a hat like Princess Marina's
So she don't care

He's bought a hat like Anthony Eden's
Because it makes him feel like a Lord
But he can't afford a Rolls or a Bentley
He has to buy a secondhand Ford
He tries to feed his wife and his family
And buy them clothes and shoes they can wear
But he's bought a hat like Anthony Eden's
So he don t care

Buddy can you spare me a dime
My wife is getting hungry
And the kids are crying
This poverty is hurting my pride
Buddy can you spare me, buddy can you spare me a dime

She's bought a hat like Princess Marina's
And her neighbors think it suits her a treat
But she hasn't any food in the larder
Nor has anybody else in the street
But to look at her you'd think she was wealthy
'Cos she smiles just like a real millionaire
'Cos she's bought a hat like Princess Marina's
So she don't care, she don't care, she don't care, she don't care

Young And Innocent Days_EOT
 
I look back at the way I used to look at life
Soft, white dreams with sugar coated outside
It was great, so great
Young and innocent days

I wish my eyes could only see
Everything, exactly as it used to be
It's too late, so late
Young and innocent days

I see the lines across your face
Time has gone and nothing ever can replace
Those great, so great
Young and innocent days

Nothing To Say_EOT
 
Remember walking with you by my side
You were my Papa and I was your pride
Now I've got children and I'm going grey
No time for talking I got nothin' to say

Those Sunday dinners that we had at home
Now I've got a house and I've got friends of my own
We can't do tomorrow what we did yesterday
It's best that we're going our separate ways, OK

How is your rheumatism (nothing to say)
How are your chillblains (nothing to say)
How's Aunty Mabel (nothing to say)
So far Papa, I got nothin' to say, OK

Those happy days we spent together
We thought our world would never change
How the days go by
And things will never be the same

You keep pretending that everything's fine
So you make small talk to help pass the time
But all the words that you spit from your face
Add up to nothin' you got nothin' to say

How are those noisy neighbors next door
I'll have to go soon 'cos I'm getting bored
I gotta be home early to see a good play
So far Papa, I got nothin' to say

How is your life insurance (nothing to say)
How is your trade union (nothing to say)
How is your Independence (nothing to say)
So for Papa, I got nothin' to say

Arthur_EOT
 
Arthur was born just a plain simple man
In a plain simple working class position
Though the world was hard and its ways were set
He was young and he had so much ambition
All the way he was overtaken
By the people who make the big decisions
But he tried and he tried for a better life
And a way to improve his own condition
If only life were easy it would be such fun
Things would be more equal and be plenty for everyone
Arthur the world's gone and passed you by
Don't you know it, don't you know it
You can cry, cry all night but it won't make it right

How is your life and your Shangri-la
And your long lost land of Hallelujah
And your hope and glory has passed you by
Can't you see what the world is doing to ya
And now we see your children
Sailing off in the setting sun
To a new horizon
Where there's plenty for everyone
Arthur, could be
That the world was wrong
Don't ya know it, don't ya know it
Arthur, could be
You were right all along
Don't ya know it, I hope ya know it

Arthur we like you and want to help you
Oh! we love you and want to help you

Drivin'_EOT
 
It seems like all the world is fighting
They're even talking of a war
Let all the Russians and the Chinese
And the Spanish do their fighting
The sun is shining
We're going drivin', drivin'

Drop all your work
Leave it behind
Forget all your problems
And get in my car
And take a drive with me

The sandwiches are packed
The tea is in the flask
We've plenty of beer
And gooseberry tarts
So take a drive with me

We'll take your mother if you want to
We'll have a picnic on the grass
Forget your nephews
And your cousins and your brothers and your sisters
They'll never miss us
'Cos we'll be drivin', drivin'. drivin'. drivin'

Thousands of trees
Hundreds of fields
Millions of birds
So why don't you come
And take a drive with me

We'll talk to the cows
And laugh at the sheep
We'll lie in a field
And we'll have a sleep
So take a drive with me

And all the troubled world around us
Seems an eternity away
And all the debt collectors
Rent collectors
All will be behind us
But they'll never find us
'Cos we'll be drivin', drivin', drivin', drivin'

Passed Barnet Church
Up to Potters Bar
We won't be home late
It's not very far
So take a drive with me, take a drive with me
Drivin', drivin', drivin', drivin'

Mindless Child Of Motherhood_EOT
 
I've been traveling a long time,
To be just where you are.
In dreams I have seen you,
But you are so very far.

How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?
How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?

I was your friend,
I was a fool,
I feel for you, though we're far apart.
I see your face,
Lost without trace,
I see your mind, just an empty space.

Mindless child of motherhood,
You have lost the thing that's good.
Mindless child of motherhood,
You have lost the thing that's good.

I know that it's not fair,
To bare a bastard son,
But why do you hide there,
When we could have shared a love?

How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?
How long must I travel on,
To be just where you are?

I was your friend,
I was a fool,
I feel for you, though we're far apart.
I see your face,
Lost without trace,
I see your mind, just an empty space.

Mindless child of motherhood,
You have lost the thing that's good.
Mindless child of motherhood,
You have lost the thing that's good.

To me.

This Man He Weeps Tonight_EOT
 
I wish that you could see
All the things that I have seen.
This mind of mine is making life worthwhile.
I wish that you'd have know
Of all the plans I had in store for us,
Laughing, dancing, traveling the world on our own.

And this man, he weeps tonight,
And his head is bowed with sorrow,
But what can you do, sitting there,
And you let him cry tomorrow,
Yes, you'll let him cry tomorrow.
Yes, you'll let him cry tomorrow.

I thought our thing would last,
'Cause it said so in my horoscope,
The days have gone and past while dreaming away.
The lighting here is dim,
And the room closes in around me.
Your picture's hanging loose on a rusting nail.

And this man, he weeps tonight,
And his head is bowed with sorrow,
But what can you do, sitting there,
And you let him cry tomorrow,
Yes, you'll let him cry tomorrow.
Yes, you'll let him cry tomorrow.

And this man, he weeps tonight,
And his head is bowed with sorrow,
But what can you do, sitting there,
And you let him cry tomorrow,

Mr. Shoemaker's Daughter_EOT
 
Hey, Mr. Shoemaker's daughter,

Don't throw my love away.
I'm coming home today.

Hey, Mr. Green Grocer's daughter,
Hey, Mr. Green Grocer's daughter,
Don't turn your head away.
Don't take the sun away.

Every time I see you I wanna say "hey".
But every time you see me you walking away from me.
I've been gone for such a long, long time,
But I'm coming home, gonna make you mine.

Hey, Mr. Cake Baker's daughter,
Hey, Mr. Bread Baker's daughter,

Don't hide the world[?] away.

Every time I see you I wanna say "hey".
But every time you see me you walking away from me.
I've been gone for such a long, long time,
But I'm coming home, gonna make you mine.

How is that fresh morning feeling?
How is the dawn and the evening?
I will be free today.

Hey, Mr. Shoemaker's daughter,
I'll see you soon today.

Hey, Mr. Dress Maker's daughter,
Hey, Mr. Green Seller's daughter,
Don't throw my love away.

The Contenders_EOT
 
Hush little mammy don't you cry
I've got to see what it's like on the world outside
Got to get out of this life somehow
Got to be free, got to be free now

I don't want to be a constructor of highways
A sweeper of sidewalks, I've got to do it my way
I'm too ill-equipped for a mathematician
A shrewd politician, a maker of decisions

We're not the greatest when when we're separated
But when we're together I think we're going to make it
I don't want to be like a fascist dictator
A saint or a sinner, I want to be a winner

Strangers_EOT
 
Where are you going I don't mind
I've killed my world and I've killed my time
So where do I go what do I see
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Till peace we find tell you what I'll do
All the things I own I will share with you
If I feel tomorrow like I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'Cos soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

Denmark Street_EOT
 
Down the way from the Tottenham Court Road
Just round the corner from old Soho
There's a place where the publishers go
If you don't know which way to go
Just open your ears and follow your nose
'Cos the street is shakin' from the tapping of toes
You can hear that music play anytime on any day
Every rhythm, every way
You got to a publisher and play him your song
He says 'I hate your music and you hair is too long
But I'll sign you up because I'd hate to be wrong'
You've got a tune it's in your head you want to get it placed
So you take it up to a music man just to see what he will say
He says 'I hate the tune, I hate the words but I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll sign you up and take it round the street and see if it makes the grade'
And you might even hear it played on the rock 'n' roll hit parade
Daytime, night time, every week you can hear that heavy beat
Now the walls are shaking from the tapping of feet
Daytime, night time, every day you can hear that music play
Every rhythm, every way

Get Back In Line_EOT
 
Facing the world ain't easy when there isn't anything going
Standing at the corner waiting watching time go by
Will I go to work today or shall I bide my time
'Cos when I see that union man walking down the street
He's the man who decides if I live or I die, if I starve, or I eat
Then he walks up to me and the sun begins to shine
Then he walks right past and I know that I've got to get back in the line
Now I think of what my mamma told me
She always said that it would never ever work out
But all I want to do is make some money
And bring you home some wine
For I don't ever want you to see me
Standing in that line
'Cause that union man's got such a hold over me
He's the man who decides if I live or I die, if I starve, or I eat
Then he walks up to me and the sun begins to shine
Then he walks right past and I know that I've got to get back in the line

Lola_EOT
 
I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola [LP version - Coca-Cola:]
C O L A cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L O L A Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walk like a woman but talk like a man
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said little boy won't you come home with me
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me

Well that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Well I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said little boy I'm gonna make you a man

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Top Of The Pops_EOT
 
I've just come in at Number 25
I'm oh so happy, so glad to be alive
And everybody says it's going to get to the top
Life is so easy when your record's hot.
Go tell my mamma and my sister too
To press my trousers and polish my shoes
I might even end up a rock-and-roll god
It might turn into a steady job.
And my agent said to me: "Son, I always told you so."
Now my record's number 11 on the BBC
But number seven on the N.M.E.
Not the Melody Maker want to interview me
And ask my view on politics and theories on religion.
Now my record's up to number 3
And a woman recognized me and started to scream
This all seems like a crazy dream
I've been invited to a dinner with a prominent queen
And now I've got friends that I never knew I had before.
It's strange how people want you when you record's high
'Cos when it drops down they just pass you by
Now my agent just called me and said it me:
"Son your record's just got to Number One."

The Moneygoround_EOT
 
Robert owes half to Grenville
Who in turn gave half to Larry
Who adored my instrumentals
And so he gave half to a foreign publisher
She took half the money that was earned in some far distant land
Gave back half to Larry and I end up with half of goodness knows what
Oh can somebody explain why things go on this way
I thought they were my friends I can't believe it's me, I can't believe that I'm so green
Eyes down round and round let's all sit and watch the moneygoround
Everyone take a little bit here and a little bit there
Do they all deserve money from a song that they've never heard
They don't know the tune and they don't know the words
But they don't give a damn
There's no end to it I'm in a pit and I'm stuck in it
The money goes round and around and around
And it comes out here when they've all taken their share
I went to see a solicitor and my story was heard and the writs were served
On the verge of a nervous breakdown I decided to fight right to the end
But if I ever get my money I'll be too old and grey to spend it
Oh, but life goes on and on and no one ever wins
And time goes quickly by just like the moneygoround
I only hope that I'll survive

This Time Tomorrow_EOT
 
This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere, sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow what will we know
Will we still be here, watching an in-flight movie show
I'll leave the sun behind me and I'll watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
Seven miles below me I can see the world and it ain't so big at all
Well, this time tomorrow what will we see
Fields full of houses, endless rows of crowded streets
I don't know where I'm going, I don't want to see
I feel the world below me looking up at me

Leave the sun behind me, and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
And I'm in perpetual motion and the world below doesn't matter much to me
Well, this time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere, sailing across any empty sea
Well, this time tomorrow where will we be
This time tomorrow what will we see
This time tomorrow

A Long Way From Home_EOT
 
You've come a long way from the runny-nosed and scruffy kid I knew
You had such good ways
I can remember the little things that always made you smile
They made you happy
Now you think you're wiser because you're older and you think
That money buys everything
And you think you need no one to guide you
But you're still a long way from home.
You've come a long way, you're self-assured and dressed in
Funny clothes, but you don't know me.
I hope you find what you are looking for with your car and handmade overcoats
But your wealth will never make you stronger 'cos you're still a
Long way from home
Yes, you're still a long way from home

Rats_EOT
 
I was lost just wandering round downtown
Many people pushing me around
Hate spreads just like infection
Those rats jumping on and off my back
Fat black rats holding me down
I see rats in every direction
No time to catch your breath
Crazy people lost their heads
Masses trampling on my feet, inconsiderate in their heat
Those rats breeding angriness and spite
Never have done anything right for people like you and me
Walk over all the people you can't see
If they die there's more bread for me
Like snakes crawling through the grass
No time to catch your breath
Crazy people lost their heads
Masses trampling on my feet, inconsiderate in their heat
Those rats breeding angriness and spite
Never have done anything right for people like you and me
See that face man look at me, he's much too selfish to see
Once he was warm and was kind
Now all he has got is a pinstripe mind
See that face man look at me, he's much too selfish to see
Once he was warm and was kind
Now all he has got is a pinstripe mind

Apeman_EOT
 
I think I'm sophisticated
'Cos I'm living my life like a good homosapien
But all around me everybody's multiplying
Till they're walking round like flies man
So I'm no better than the animals sitting in their cages
In the zoo man
'Cos compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees
I am an ape man
I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized
'Cos I'm a strict vegetarian
But with the over-population and inflation and starvation
And the crazy politicians
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an ape man
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man I'm a King Kong man I'm ape ape man
I'm an ape man
'Cos compared to the sun that sits in the sky
Compared to the clouds as they roll by
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies
I am an ape man
In man's evolution he has created the cities and
The motor traffic rumble, but give me half a chance
And I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle
'Cos the only time that I feel at ease
Is swinging up and down in a coconut tree
Oh what a life of luxury to be like an ape man
I'm an ape, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man
I'm an ape man
I look out my window, but I can't see the sky
'Cos the air pollution is fogging up my eyes
I want to get out of this city alive
And make like an ape man
Come and love me, be my ape man girl
And we will be so happy in my ape man world
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man
I'm an ape man
I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane
And we'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day
Just like an ape man
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man
I'm an ape man.
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore
And make like an ape man.

Powerman_EOT
 
I know a man, he's a powerful man
He's got the people in his power
In the palm of his hand.
He started at the bottom and he worked his way up
Now he's never going to stop
Until he reaches the top.
It's the same old story, it's the same old dream,
It's power man, power man, and all that it can bring.
If you want your money, you better stand in the line
'Cos you'll only end up picking up nickels and dimes.
You call him names and he sits and grins
'Cos everybody else is just a sucker to him.
And he's got my money, but I've got my faith
And powerman, powerman, I'll never be your slave.
It's the same old story, it's the same old game
It's power man, power man, driving me insane
People tried to conquer the world Napoleon and Genghis Khan
Hitler tried and Mussolini too
Powerman don't need to fight, powerman don't need no guns
Powerman got money on his side
Well I'm not rich and I'm not free
But I've got my girl and she got me
He's got my money and my publishing rights
But I've got my girl and I'm alright
And she got me going, and she keeps me sane
But powerman, powerman, got money on the brain
It's the same old story it's the same old game
Powerman, powerman driving me insane

Got To Be Free_EOT
 
Hush little baby don't you cry
Soon the sun is going to shine
We're going to be free like the birds and the bees
Running wild in the big country
Got to be free to do what I want
Walk if I want, talk if I want
Got to be free to say what I want
Make what I want and play what I want
As free as the birds up in the sky
As free as the bugs and the spiders and flies
I don't know how but I'm gonna try
I've just got to be free
And it won't be long 'cos we're right
And they are wrong
We've got to get out of this world somehow
We've got to be free, we've got to be free now
Got to be free to laugh when I want
Think what I want and cry if I like
Got to be free to do what I want
Say what I want and swear if I like
As free as the sun and the moon in the sky
As free as a flea or a proud butterfly
I don't know how but I'm gonna try
I've just got to be free
Yeah, we've got to get out of this world somehow
We've got to be free, we've got to be free now
Got to be free to do what I want
Walk if I want and talk if I want
Got to be free to say what I want
Make what I want and play what I want
I've got to be proud and stand up straight
And let people see I ain't nobody's slave
I've got to be free before it's too late
I've just got to be free
Got to be free to do what I want
Walk if I want, talk if I want

God's Children_EOT
 
Man made the buildings that reach for the sky
And man made the motorcar and learned how to fly
But he didn't make the flowers and he didn't make the trees
And he didn't make you and he didn't make me
And he got no right to turn us into machines
He's got no right at all
'Cause we are all God's children
And he got no right to change us
Oh, we gotta go back the way the good lord made us all

Don't want this world to change me
I wanna go back the way the good lord made me
Same lungs that he gave me to breath with
Same eyes he gave me to see with

Oh, the rich man, the poor man, the saint and the sinner
The wise man, the simpleton, the loser and the winner
We are all the same to Him
Stripped of our clothes and all the things we own
The day that we are born
We are all God's children
And they got no right to change us
Oh, we gotta go back the way the good lord made
Oh, the good lord made us all
And we are all his children
And they got no right to change us
Oh, we gotta go back the way the good lord made us all
Yeah, we gotta go back the way the good lord made us all

The Way Love Used To Be_EOT
 
I know a place not far from here
It's not far away, love, but if you come
I know a place where we'll be alone
And we'll talk of life, the way love used to be

I know a place not far away
And we'll find a way through the city streets
We'll find a way through the mad rushing crowd
And we'll talk about the way love used to be

I know a place not far from here
It's not far away, love, but if you come
I know a place where we'll be alone
And we'll talk about the way love used to be

Moments_EOT
 
Come on love
Let's forget about all the things that we've done wrong
Just remember all of the things that we've done right
I'm in no mood to argue and I'm in no mood to fight
So let the tears pass you by
Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry
And I ain't gonna let this big world get me down
I gotta learn to keep a hold of my head and keep my feet on the ground
Moments of ecstatic happiness
And the moments of stress that we had better forget
But love, I gotta feeling that I've said it all before
I said it before
I say I'll never do you wrong but then I go and do the same again
I don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why, don't know why
We gotta learn to share these moments in our lives
And never let it get us down, we gotta put up a fight
Moments to remember all our lives
From the first brief hello to the last good-bye

I say I'll never do you wrong but then I go and do the same again
I don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why, don't know why
We gotta learn to share these moments in our lives
And never let it get us down, we gotta put up a fight
Moments to remember all our lives
From the first brief hello to the last good-bye

Animals In The Zoo_EOT
 
You're just an animal in the zoo
Sittin' round feeling persecuted and abused
You're locked up and I'm on the loose
But I can't quite tell who's looking at who
'Cause I'm an animal, too
But you're locked up in a zoo
And you look at me and I look at you

God made the heaven and the deep blue sea
But man picked the flowers and he pulled up the trees
God mad the moon and the rain and the sun
But man made the money and the bombs and the guns
So we're all animals, too
But you're locked up in a zoo
And you look at me and I look at you

I'm a prisoner but I got no cage
I'm locked up but I got no chain
But the good guys lose and the bad guys win
That's why you're looking out and I'm looking in
But we're all animals, too
But you're locked up in a zoo
'Cause you look at me and I look at you

Just Friends_EOT
 
Please step inside
Just for a while
I want to befriend you
And just make you smile

You've nothing to lose
I've nothing to gain
I shall not molest you
I shan't break your brain[?]

Friends we'll become
Friends we will stay
Friends till forever
Or just today

Please don't deceive
Please don't pretend
Just be my companion
And friend till the end

Dreams_EOT
 
When I look so far away
Please don't wake me from my dreams
I'm just wondering who I could be
If I lived inside my dreams

I could be a king or a football star
Drive around in a big sports car
An astronaut or a millionaire
I could do anything or go anywhere

Dream I'm far away
Dream I'm far away

Racing driver or a great politician
A man of power or a man of religion
I could be almost anything
If I could live inside my dreams

Dream I'm far away
Dream I'm far away
Please don't wake me from my dreams
Please don't wake me from my dreams
Please don't wake me from my dreams

When I look so far away
Please don't wake me from my daze
I'm just wondering who I could be
If I lived inside my dreams

Willesden Green_EOT
 
Well I tried to settle down Fulham Broadway
And I tried to make my home in Golders Green
But I gotta get that train
And go back home again
Oh how I miss the folks back home in Willesden Green

You know, I tried, I really tried to settle in this big city
And I always thought I could make it all on my very own
But there's one thing that keeps calling me
To that little, that little semi-detached
That's the folks, yeah, the folks back home
In Willesden Green

20th Century Man_EOT
 
This is the age of machinery,
A mechanical nightmare,
The wonderful world of technology,
Napalm, hydrogen bombs, biological warfare,

This is the twentieth century,
But too much aggravation
It's the age of insanity,
What has become of the green pleasant fields of Jerusalem.

Ain't got no ambition, I'm just disillusioned
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.
My mama said she can't understand me
She can't see my motivation
Just give me some security,
I'm a paranoid schizoid product of the twentieth century.

You keep all your smart modern writers
Give me William Shakespeare
You keep all your smart modern painters
I'll take Rembrandt, Titian, Da Vinci and Gainsborough,

Girl we gotta get out of here
We gotta find a solution
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't want to die here.

I was born in a welfare state
Ruled by bureaucracy
Controlled by civil servants
And people dressed in grey
Got no privacy, got no liberty
Cos the twentieth century people
Took it all away from me.

Don't wanna get myself shot down
By some trigger happy policeman,
Gotta keep a hold on my sanity
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna die here.

My mama says she can't understand me
She can't see my motivation
Ain't got no security,
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.

This is the twentieth century
But too much aggravation
This is the edge of insanity
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.

Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues_EOT
 
I'm too terrified to walk out of my own front door,
They're demonstrating outside I think they're gonna start the third world war,
I've been to my local head shrinker,
To help classify my disease,
He said it's one of the cases of acute schizophrenia he sees.

Well the milkman's a spy, and the grocer keeps on following me,
And the woman next door's an undercover for the K.G.B.,
And the man from the Social Security
Keeps on invading my privacy,
Oh there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease.

I've got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too,
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia,
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose,
Acute schizophrenia blues.

I'm lost on the river, the river of no return,
I can't make decisions, I don't know which way I'm gonna turn,
Even my old dad, lost some of the best friends he ever had,
Apparently, his was a case of acute schizophrenia too.

I got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too,
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia,
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose,

They're watching my house and they're tapping my telephone,
I don't trust nobody, but I'm much too scared to be on my own
And the income tax collector's got his beady eye on me,
No there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease.

No there ain't no cure for
Schizophrenia disease.

Holiday_EOT
 
Holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I'm oh so glad they sent me away,
To have a little holiday today, holiday.
Holiday,
And I'm just standing on the end of a pier,
Hoping and dreaming you were here,
To share my little holiday.

Lookin' in the sky for a gap in the clouds,
Sometimes I think that sun ain't never coming out,
But I'd rather be here than in that dirty old town,
I had to leave the city cos it really brought me down.

Oh holiday, oh what a lovely day today,
I think I'll get down on my little ol' knees and pray, thank you Lord,
Thank heaven for this holiday today, holiday.
I'm leaving insecurity behind me,
The environmental pressures got me down,
I don't need no sedatives to pull me round,
I don't need no sleeping pills to help me sleep sound.

Oh holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I think I'll get down on my little ol' knees and pray,
That's what I'll do,
Thank heaven for this holiday.

Lying on the beach with my back burned rare,
The salt gets in my blisters and the sand gets in my hair,
And the sea's an open sewer,
But I really couldn't care,
I'm breathing through my mouth so I don't have to sniff the air.

Oh holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I'm so glad they sent me away,
To have a little holiday.

Skin And Bone_EOT
 
Fat Flabby Annie was incredibly big
She weighed just about sixteen stone
And then a fake dietician went and put her on a diet
Now she looks like skin and bone
She looks like skin and bone

Do the meditation and yoga
And she's thrown away the good food guide
And she's given up the alcohol and pizzas
And the pies and now she looks as if she's ready to die,
You can't see her walk by

Don't eat no mashed potatoes,
Don't eat no buttered scones
Stay away from carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

Living on the edge of starvation
And she says she's got no appetite
And her father and her mother
And her sisters and her brothers
Couldn't see her when she walked by
You can't see her walk by.

She don't eat no mashed potatoes,
She don't eat no buttered scones
Stay away from carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

She used to be so cuddly,
She used to be so fat,
But oh what a sin cos she's oh so thin
That she lost all the friends that she had,
She looks like skin and bone

If you look flabby
And you feel overweight,
And you wanna lose a couple of stone,
Take a crash course diet do your daily exercises
And you'll look like skin and bone.

Come on rattle them bones,
Put your hands up to the ceiling,
Bend your hips and touch your toes,
Do your daily exercises,
You're gonna look like skin and bone,

Don't eat no mashed potatoes,
Don't eat no buttered scones
Don't eat no carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

Alcohol_EOT
 
Here's a story about a sinner,
He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position,
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements,
And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition,
It turned him to the booze,
And he got mixed up with a floosie
And she led him to a life of indecision.
The floosie made him spend his dole
She left him lying on Skid Row
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission.
It's such a shame.

Oh demon alcohol,
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would say,
Damn it all and blow it all,
Oh demon alcohol,
Memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.

Barley wine, pink gin,
He'll drink anything,
Port, pernod or tequila,
Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks,
As long as all his troubles disappeared.
But he messed up his life, went and beat up his wife,
And the floosie's gone and found another sucker
She's gonna turn him on to drink
She's gonna lead him to the brink
And when his money's gone,
She'll leave him in the gutter,
It's such a shame.

Oh demon alcohol,
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would say,
Damn it all and blow it all,

Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall,
A slave to demon alcohol.

Complicated Life_EOT
 
Well I woke this morning with a pain in my neck,
A pain in my heart and a pain in my chest,
I went to the doctor and the good doctor said,
You gotta slow down your life or you're gonna be dead,
Cut out the struggle and strife,
It only complicates your life.

Well I cut down women, I cut out booze,
I stopped ironing my shirts, cleaning my shoes,
I stopped going to work, stopped reading the news,
I sit and twiddle my thumbs cos I got nothing to do,
Minimal exercise,
To help uncomplicate my life,
Gotta stand and face it life is so complicated,
Ladi dah di dahdah, ladi dah di dah dah,
You gotta get away from the complicated life, son,
Life is overrated, life is complicated,
Must alleviate this complicated life.

Cut out the struggle and strife,
It's such a complicated life.

Like old Mother Hubbard
I got nothin' in the cupboard,
Got no dinner and I got no supper,
Holes in my shoes, I got holes in my socks,
I can't go to work cos I can't get a job,
The bills are rising sky high,
It's such a complicated life,
Gotta stand and face it,
Life is so complicated.
Ladi dah di dahdah, ladi dah di dah dah
Gotta get away from the complicated life, son,
Life is overrated, life is complicated,
Must alleviate this complicated life.

Gotta get away from the complicated life, son,
Gotta get away from the complicated life.

Here Come The People In Grey_EOT
 
I got a letter this morning with some serious news that's gone and ruined my day,
The borough surveyor's used compulsory purchase to acquire my domain,
They're gonna pull up the floors, they're gonna knock down the walls,
They're gonna dig up the drains.

Here come the people in grey, they're gonna take me away to Lord knows only where,
But I'm so unprepared, I got no time to pack and I got nothing to wear,
Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Me and my baby gonna get on a train that's gonna take us away,
We're gonna live in a tent, we're gonna pay no more rent, we're gonna pay no more rates,
We're gonna live in a field, we're gonna buy me gun to keep the policemen away.

I'm gonna pass me a brand new resolution,
I'm gonna fight me a one man revolution, someway,
Gonna beat those people in grey,
But here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

People in grey have gone and taken away my right to voice my complaint,
Her Majesty's Government have sent me a form, I must complete it today.
But it's making me blue, don't wanna tell all my secrets to
The people in grey.

Gonna pass me a brand new resolution,
Gonna fight me a one man revolution, someway,
Gonna start my rebellion today.
But here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Oh, Lord, those people in grey,
I gotta get back at those people in grey,
Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Have A Cuppa Tea_EOT
 
Granny's always ravin' and rantin',
And she's always puffin' and pantin',
And she's always screaming and shouting,
And she's always brewing up tea.

Grandpappy's never late for his dinner,
Cos he loves his leg of beef
And he washes it down with a brandy,
And a fresh made pot of tea.

[Chorus:]
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea.

If you feel a bit under the weather,
If you feel a little bit peeved,
Take granny's stand-by potion
For any old cough or wheeze.
It's a cure for hepatitis, it's a cure for chronic insomnia,
It's a cure for tonsillitis and for water on the knee.

[Chorus]

Tea in the morning, tea in the evening, tea at supper time,
You get tea when it's raining, tea when it's snowing,
Tea when the weather's fine.
You get tea as a mid-day stimulant
You get tea with your afternoon tea
For any old ailment or disease
For Christ sake have a cuppa tea.

[Chorus]

Whatever the situation, whatever the race or creed,
Tea knows no segregation, no class nor pedigree
It knows no motivations, no sect or organisation,
It knows no one religion,
Nor political belief.

[Chorus]

Holloway Jail_EOT
 
They took my baby to Holloway jail,
They took my baby, down Holloway jail,
She was a lady when she went in,
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.

She was just succeeding in the city,
She was just beginning to excel,
And then a spiv named Frankie Simes
Led her to a life of crime,
And led her on the downward trail.

Frankie came home late from work one evening,
The C.I.D. were hot on his trail,
Frankie promised everything,
And then he went and turned her in,
She went and took the rap for him,
Now she's impaled in Holloway jail.

They took my baby, down Holloway jail,
They took my baby to Holloway jail,
There ain't no pity, there ain't no bail,
And she assures me that it's living hell.

She was young and ever so pretty,
Now she looks so old and pale,
She never sees the day,
She wastes her life away,
Sitting in that prison cell.

They took my baby to Holloway jail,
They locked my baby in Holloway jail,
She was a lady when she went in,
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.

She's impaled, in Holloway jail.

Oklahoma U.S.A._EOT
 
All life we work but work is bore,
If life's for livin' what's livin' for,
She lives in a house that's near decay,
Built for the industrial revolution,
But in her dreams she is far away,
In Oklahoma U.S.A.
With Shirley Jones and Gordon McRea,
As she buys her paper at the corner shop,
She's walkin' on the surrey with the fringe on top,
Cos in her dreams she is far away,
In Oklahoma U.S.A.,
She walks to work but she's still in a daze,
She's Rita Hayworth or Doris Day,
And Errol Flynn's gonna take her away,
To Oklahoma U.S.A.,
All life we work but work is a bore,
If life's for livin' then what's livin' for.

Uncle Son_EOT
 
He was just a workin' man,
Simple rules and simple plans,
Fancy words he didn't understand,
He loved with his heart,
He worked with his hands.

Liberals dream of equal rights,
Conservatives live in a world gone by,
Socialists preach of a promised land,
But old Uncle Son was an ordinary man.

Bless you Uncle Son,
They won't forget you when the revolution comes.

Unionists tell you when to strike,
Generals tell you when to fight,
Preachers teach you wrong from right,
They'll feed you when you're born,
And use you all your life.

Bless you Uncle Son,
They won't forget you when the revolution comes.

Muswell Hillbilly_EOT
 
Well I said goodbye to Rosie Rooke this morning
I'm gonna miss her bloodshot alcoholic eyes
She wore her Sunday hat so she'd impress me
I'm gonna carry her memory 'til the day I die

They'll move me up to Muswell Hill tomorrow
Photographs and souvenirs are all I've got
They're gonna try and make me change my way of living
But they'll never make me something that I'm not

Cos I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in old West Virginia
Never seen New Orleans, Oklahoma, Tennessee
Still I dream of the Black Hills that I ain't never seen

They're putting us identical little boxes
No character just uniformity
They're trying to build a computerised community
But they'll never make a zombie out of me

They'll try and make me study elocution
Because they say my accent isn't right
They can clear the slums as part of their solution
But they're never gonna kill my cockney pride

Cos I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia
Though my hills, they're not green
I've seen them in my dreams
Take me back to those Black Hills
That I ain't never seen

Well I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia
Though my hills, they're not green
I've seen them in my dreams
Take me back to those Black Hills
That I ain't never seen

Mountain Woman_EOT
 
They lived together in a dirty old shack
At the edge of the black rocky mountain
And they drank mountain dew and they lived on the food
That they grew at the side of the mountain

She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
They lived all their lives by the valley
She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Uneducated but they're happy

Mountain woman couldn't read nor write
But she knew good from evil, she knew wrong from right
When the government tried to buy her water rights
Her intuition was her only guide

She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Lived all their lives by the valley
She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Uneducated but they're happy
Spend my life with my mountain woman
We're uneducated by we're happy

The civil servant used compulsory purchase
To acquire the valley for the nation
They'll dig up the land, they're gonna make a dam
And build a hydroelectric power station

And now she lives on the 33rd floor
Of a man-made concrete mountain
She got an elevator and refrigerator
And an automobile to run around in

Fast talkin' lawyers from the government
Went and beat proud mountain woman down
Hey mountain woman, take your mountain man
They took your land and flood your valley

Spend my life with my mountain woman
They're uneducated by they're happy

Kentucky Moon_EOT
 
Never been anywhere south of the Delaware
Never been through Kalamazoo
Never been to Timbuktu

Living is fantasy, traveling mentally
Making up tunes in hotel rooms
'Bout places I've never been to

Though I've never crooned under a Kentucky moon

I had my dream, Kentucky moon
But it's only moon dreams
From songs, films and TV
But I can visualize what I've never seen
But I had my dream, Kentucky moon

Route 66 to me is still a mystery
And Ohio, too
Went Chicago blue down to St. Louie blues

Never been anywhere south of the Delaware
Never been through Kalamazoo
Never been to Timbuktu

But I can visualize what I've never seen
So I sit and dream, Kentucky moon

As I sit by a stream in the moon
But it's just imagery
From songs, films and TV
But I can visualize what I've never seen
So I sit and dream, Kentucky moon

Here Comes Yet Another Day_EOT
 
Here comes yet another day, creeping through my window.
Drank myself to sleep last night, beer stains on my pillow.
I gotta pull my things together,
The night can last forever.

Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.
Can't stop, can't be late, mustn't make the people wait.
Can't even comb my hair or even change my underwear,
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day,
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.

There goes another night, here comes another flight,
Can't stop gotta go, here comes yet another show.
Gotta pack up my clothes, brush my teeth, blow my nose.

No time to use the John, gotta keep a rollin' on.
Here comes a new day, here comes a new stage,
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.

Made a lot of conversation, talked a lot of weather,
I hope we meet again some day, and spend some time together.
No time for affection,
I'm moving in a new direction.

Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day,
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.
Can't stop, can't be late, mustn't make the people wait.
Can't stop to comb my hair or even change my underwear.
See that morning break, oh Lord, here comes yet another day,

Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.

Maximum Consumption_EOT
 
I'll have some clam chowder, followed by beef steak on rye
Pumpkin pie, whipped cream and coffee,
I wanna green salad on the side,
Don't forget the french fries,
Pizza pie, garlic and anchovie.
I keep burning up calories as fast as I keep putting them down,
Eat food, put it in my mouth,
Chew it up, swallow it down,
I'll have two eggs, over light, home made apple pie
Cole slaw as a side order.
I gotta stay fit, stay alive, eat food to sustain a non-stop high-grade performer.
The pace is continual, sure keeps running me down
Don't you know that you gotta eat food,
Don't you know that you gotta refuel.
I'm a Maximum Consumption, super-grade performer.
High powered machine,
Go steady on my clutch, go easy on the hills
And you'll get a lot of mileage out of me.
I'm so easy to drive, and I'm an excellent ride,
Excessive living sure keeps running me down
You've got to learn to use the Maximum Juice
That's how you get the maximum use.
Life keeps using me, keeps on abusing me, mentally and physically.
I gotta stay fit, stay alive, need fuel inside, eat food to survive
Maximum Consumption sure keeps running me down
Don't you know that you gotta eat food
Don't you know that it's good for you.
I'm a Maximum Consumption,
Non-stop machine
Total automation perpetual motion.

Unreal Reality (The Real Thing)_EOT
 
All that I see, seems so unreal to me,
Is it the truth or is it only fantasy,
Is it a dream or is it unreal reality?

All around me is such unreality,
Optical illusions as far as my eyes can see,
Is the whole thing a fake, or the ultimate reality?

That house is so big that it reaches right up to the clouds
It's got hundreds of windows, so the people inside can look out,
And they look down below and wonder what it's all about.

Look at that lady she got silver all over her face,
Is she a human being or a creature from outer space,
Is she authentic or phoney, I guess it's just a matter of taste.

Oh because they can feel it, it's gotta be the real thing,
Because they can touch it, it's gotta be reality.
If they say it's real, it's gotta be the real thing.

See that fella, looking all spick and span,
Is he a tailor's dummy or is he a real man,
Is he genuine, or straight off the assembly line.

All round me is such unreality,
Optical illusions as far as my eyes can see,
Is the whole thing a fake or the ultimate reality?

Is it a dream, or is it the real reality?

Hot Potatoes_EOT
 
My baby woke me up this mornin'
She said get down that labour exchange,
And if you don't come home with a job son,
You'll get no dinner to-day.
You gotta secure me a weekly workin' wage.
You'll get no more fancy cookin',
You'll get no more apple pie,
You'll just get those plain hot potatoes
To satisfy your appetite.

La la la la la la Potatoes,
Boiled, French fried, any old way that you wanna decide.
Hot potatoes, yeh,
I want your lovin' every single day.

I said I don't need your fancy cooking,
I like the simple things in life,
Just give me those plain hot potatoes
And I'll be well satisfied,
They'll satisfy my appetite.

La la la la la la Potatoes,
Boiled, French fried, any old way that you wanna decide.
Hot potatoes, yeh,
I want your lovin' 60 minutes an hour,
I want your lovin' 24 hours a day,
I want your lovin' 7 days a week.
Yeh, yeh, oh yeh.
I want your love, I need your love,
But all I get is hot potatoes
When I come home late at night
To satisfy my appetite.

Don't give me no more potatoes,
Boiled, French fried, any old way you wanna decide.
Hot potatoes,
I want your lovin' every single day.
I want your lovin'

La la la la la la Potatoes,
Boiled, French fried, any old way that you wanna decide.
Hot potatoes, Hot potatoes, yeh.

Sitting In My Hotel_EOT
 
If my friends could see me now, driving round just like a film star,
In a chauffeur driven jam jar, they would laugh.
They would all be saying that it's not really me,
They would all be asking who I'm trying to be.
If my friends could see me now,
Looking out my hotel window,
Dressed in satin strides and two-tone daisy roots,
If my friends could see me now I know they would smile.

Sitting in my hotel, hiding from the dramas of this great big world,
Seven stories high, looking at the world go by-y.
Sitting in my hotel room, thinking about the countryside and sunny days in June.
Trying to hide the gloom, sitting in my hotel room.

If my friends could see me now, dressing up in my bow-tie,
Prancing round the room like some outrageous poove,
They would tell me that I'm just being used
They would ask me what I'm trying to prove.
They would see me in my hotel,
Watching late shows till the morning,
Writing songs for old time vaudeville revues.
All my friends would ask me what it's all leading to.

Sitting in my hotel, looking through the window at the people in the street,
Seven stories high looking at the world go by,
Sitting in my hotel, looking at the world outside.

If my friends could see me now they would try to understand me,
They would ask me what on earth I'm trying to prove.
All my friends would ask me what it's all leading to.

Motorway_EOT
 
Motorway food is the worst in the world,
You've never eaten food like you've eaten on the motorway.
Motorway food is the worst in the world,
The coffee tastes weak and the cakes taste stale
And gasoline fumes are the worst to inhale,
Your stomach rolls over and your face turns pale.

Oh, that motorway livin',
Ain't it a thrill to be so free, yeh.
Riding down the motorway,
Got to charge up my batteries,
Rest my seat, rest my eyes,

So tired, tired of livin', tired of livin' this motorway livin'.

Motorway tea is warm and wet,
The rain is a pouring and it's four in the morning,
And it's all I can get.
You've never seen loos like motorway loos,
Thousands of people passing through,
It's enough to put you off of your motorway food.

Oh that motorway living,
Ain't it a thrill to be so free, yeh.
Got to get away from
Cats eyes, cold meat pies,
Thousand on raft, cold French fries
So tired, tired of livin', tired of livin' this motorway livin'.

Motorway food is invariably fried,
It keeps me and feeds me and helps me survive.
Oh that motorway, ain't it a thrill to be so free, yeh,
Riding down the motorway, cats eyes, cold meat pies
Thousand on raft, cold French fries,
So tired, tired of livin', tired of livin' this motorway livin'.

Motorway food is the worst in the world,
You'll never eat food like you've eaten on the motorway.
Motorway food is the worst in the world.

My stomach's upset and I don't feel well,
Gotta get my head down, stop for a while in a motorway hotel.
Mama oh mama, my dear Suzi too,
This motorway message is sent just for you.
My headache's improved but my back really hurts,
I never thought I'd travel so far to work.

You Don't Know My Name_EOT
 
I've been travelling on this road
I get the feeling its getting on
I keep moving on
I keep rolling on
But does anybody know my name

Travelling oh so long
I get the feeling thats something's wrong
I keep rolling on
I keep rolling on
But does anybody know my name.

How could you believe when you don't know my name

[Repeat]

I see life is such a simple game
I sit and watch it from my moving train
A bumpy ride to-day
I'm not alone this way
Does anybody know my name.

Arrested in '69
For upsetting a tourist guide
Well pay the fine or jail
I just smiled and said
That I'm oh so glad to be alive.

How could you believe when you don't know my name

[Repeat]

How could you believe when you don't understand.

Supersonic Rocket Ship_EOT
 
Let me take you on a little trip
My supersonic ship's at your disposal
If you feel so inclined. Well alright.
We're gonna travel faster than light
So do up your overcoat tight
And you'll go anywhere you want to decide. Well alright.
Too many people side by side
Got no place to hide.

On my supersonic rocket ship
Nobody has to be hip
Nobody needs to be out of sight. Out of sight.
Nobody's gonna travel second class
There'll be equality
And no suppression of minorities. Well alright.
We'll take this planet, shake it round
And turn it upside down.
My supersonic rocket ship.

It ain't no magic, ain't no lie,
You'll laugh so loud you'll cry.
Up and down, round and round
On my supersonic rocket ship.

Let me take you on a little trip
My supersonic ship's at your disposal
If you feel so inclined. Well alright.
Nobody's gonna travel second class
There'll be equality
And no suppression of minorities. Well alright.
Let me take you on a little trip
On my supersonic rocket ship.

Look A Little On The Sunny Side_EOT
 
Look a little on the sunny side
Even when they say you're on the slide,
And for a while they'll say your records never make it,
But in a while they're gonna be showering you with praises.
They'll give you mediocre reviews
And put you in the underground for a while,
But look a little on the funny, sunny side of life,
Look a little on the sunny side.

You sing 'em the blues
And then they ask for a happy tune,
And when you start to smile they'll say gimme dat rhythm and blues,
And when you give 'em dat rhythm and blues they'll simply smile and say
We didn't want to hear you play,
We didn't like you any way.
It's very hard to please the people every single time,
But look a little on the sunny side.

Look a little on the sunny side
Even when you feel you want to hide,
You gotta laugh, don't let your critics ever upset you,
'Cos for a while the cynics will all be out to get you.
You gotta be shrewd, you gotta be strong
You've gotta convince yourself that you are not wrong,
Whistle a tune and think of a catchy, happy, little song
And look a little on the sunny side.

It's very hard to please the people every single time,
But look a little on the sunny side.

They're gonna put you down for a while
You've got to learn to grit your teeth and smile
And look a little on the funny, sunny side of life,
Look a little on the sunny side.

Celluloid Heroes_EOT
 
Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star,
And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are.
There are stars in every city,
In every house and on every street,
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete!

Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard,
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard
But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne,
But she turned her back on stardom,
Because she wanted to be alone.

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard,
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of,
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.
Rudolph Valentino, looks very much alive,
And he looks up ladies' dresses as they sadly pass him by.
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cos he's liable to turn and bite,
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life.
If you covered him with garbage,
George Sanders would still have style,
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn round and smile,
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
'Cos she's not very tough,
She should have been made of iron or steel,
But she was only made of flesh and blood.

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard,
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of.
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.

Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star
And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are.

And those who are successful,
Be always on your guard,
Success walks hand in hand with failure
Along Hollywood Boulevard.

I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show,
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes,
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die.

You can see all the stars as you walk along Hollywood Boulevard,
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of,
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.

Oh celluloid heroes never feel any pain
Oh celluloid heroes never really die.

I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show,
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes,
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die.

Top Of The Pops_EOT
 
I've just come in at Number 25
I'm oh so happy, so glad to be alive
And everybody says it's going to get to the top
Life is so easy when your record's hot.
Go tell my mamma and my sister too
To press my trousers and polish my shoes
I might even end up a rock-and-roll god
It might turn into a steady job.
And my agent said to me: "Son, I always told you so."
Now my record's number 11 on the BBC
But number seven on the N.M.E.
Not the Melody Maker want to interview me
And ask my view on politics and theories on religion.
Now my record's up to number 3
And a woman recognized me and started to scream
This all seems like a crazy dream
I've been invited to a dinner with a prominent queen
And now I've got friends that I never knew I had before.
It's strange how people want you when you record's high
'Cos when it drops down they just pass you by
Now my agent just called me and said it me:
"Son your record's just got to Number One."

Brainwashed_EOT
 
You look like a real human being
But you don't have a mind of your own
Yeah, you can talk, you can breathe
You can work, you can stitch, you can sew
But you're brainwashed
Yes you are, yes you are
Get down on your knees
You've got a job and a house
And a wife, and your kids and a car
Yeah, you're conditioned to be
What they want you to be
And be happy to be where you are
Yes you are
Get down on your knees
Get down on your knees

The aristocrats and bureaucrats
Are dirty rats
For making you what you are
They're up there and you re down here
You're on the ground and they're up with the stars
All your life they've kicked you around and pushed you around
Till you can't take any more
To them you're just a speck of dirt
But you don't want to get up off the floor
Mister you're just brainwashed
They give you social security
Tax saving benefits that grow at maturity
Yeah, you're conditioned to be
What they want you to be
And to do what they want you to
Yes you are, yes you are
Get down on your knees

Mr. Wonderful_EOT
 
It's that strange and tender magic you do.
Mr. Wonderful,
That's you.

Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues_EOT
 
I'm too terrified to walk out of my own front door,
They're demonstrating outside I think they're gonna start the third world war,
I've been to my local head shrinker,
To help classify my disease,
He said it's one of the cases of acute schizophrenia he sees.

Well the milkman's a spy, and the grocer keeps on following me,
And the woman next door's an undercover for the K.G.B.,
And the man from the Social Security
Keeps on invading my privacy,
Oh there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease.

I've got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too,
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia,
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose,
Acute schizophrenia blues.

I'm lost on the river, the river of no return,
I can't make decisions, I don't know which way I'm gonna turn,
Even my old dad, lost some of the best friends he ever had,
Apparently, his was a case of acute schizophrenia too.

I got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too,
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia,
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose,

They're watching my house and they're tapping my telephone,
I don't trust nobody, but I'm much too scared to be on my own
And the income tax collector's got his beady eye on me,
No there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease.

No there ain't no cure for
Schizophrenia disease.

Holiday_EOT
 
Holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I'm oh so glad they sent me away,
To have a little holiday today, holiday.
Holiday,
And I'm just standing on the end of a pier,
Hoping and dreaming you were here,
To share my little holiday.

Lookin' in the sky for a gap in the clouds,
Sometimes I think that sun ain't never coming out,
But I'd rather be here than in that dirty old town,
I had to leave the city cos it really brought me down.

Oh holiday, oh what a lovely day today,
I think I'll get down on my little ol' knees and pray, thank you Lord,
Thank heaven for this holiday today, holiday.
I'm leaving insecurity behind me,
The environmental pressures got me down,
I don't need no sedatives to pull me round,
I don't need no sleeping pills to help me sleep sound.

Oh holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I think I'll get down on my little ol' knees and pray,
That's what I'll do,
Thank heaven for this holiday.

Lying on the beach with my back burned rare,
The salt gets in my blisters and the sand gets in my hair,
And the sea's an open sewer,
But I really couldn't care,
I'm breathing through my mouth so I don't have to sniff the air.

Oh holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I'm so glad they sent me away,
To have a little holiday.

Muswell Hillbilly_EOT
 
Well I said goodbye to Rosie Rooke this morning
I'm gonna miss her bloodshot alcoholic eyes
She wore her Sunday hat so she'd impress me
I'm gonna carry her memory 'til the day I die

They'll move me up to Muswell Hill tomorrow
Photographs and souvenirs are all I've got
They're gonna try and make me change my way of living
But they'll never make me something that I'm not

Cos I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in old West Virginia
Never seen New Orleans, Oklahoma, Tennessee
Still I dream of the Black Hills that I ain't never seen

They're putting us identical little boxes
No character just uniformity
They're trying to build a computerised community
But they'll never make a zombie out of me

They'll try and make me study elocution
Because they say my accent isn't right
They can clear the slums as part of their solution
But they're never gonna kill my cockney pride

Cos I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia
Though my hills, they're not green
I've seen them in my dreams
Take me back to those Black Hills
That I ain't never seen

Well I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia
Though my hills, they're not green
I've seen them in my dreams
Take me back to those Black Hills
That I ain't never seen

Alcohol_EOT
 
Here's a story about a sinner,
He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position,
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements,
And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition,
It turned him to the booze,
And he got mixed up with a floosie
And she led him to a life of indecision.
The floosie made him spend his dole
She left him lying on Skid Row
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission.
It's such a shame.

Oh demon alcohol,
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would say,
Damn it all and blow it all,
Oh demon alcohol,
Memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.

Barley wine, pink gin,
He'll drink anything,
Port, pernod or tequila,
Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks,
As long as all his troubles disappeared.
But he messed up his life, went and beat up his wife,
And the floosie's gone and found another sucker
She's gonna turn him on to drink
She's gonna lead him to the brink
And when his money's gone,
She'll leave him in the gutter,
It's such a shame.

Oh demon alcohol,
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would say,
Damn it all and blow it all,

Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall,
A slave to demon alcohol.

Banana Boat Song_EOT
 
Day-oh, Day-oh
Daylight come and I wanna go home
Day-oh, Day-oh
Daylight come and I wanna go home

Workin' on banana boat all day long
Daylight come and I wanna go home
Six boat, seven boat, eight boat job
Daylight come and I wanna go home

Day-oh, Day-oh
Daylight come and I wanna go home

Skin And Bone_EOT
 
Fat Flabby Annie was incredibly big
She weighed just about sixteen stone
And then a fake dietician went and put her on a diet
Now she looks like skin and bone
She looks like skin and bone

Do the meditation and yoga
And she's thrown away the good food guide
And she's given up the alcohol and pizzas
And the pies and now she looks as if she's ready to die,
You can't see her walk by

Don't eat no mashed potatoes,
Don't eat no buttered scones
Stay away from carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

Living on the edge of starvation
And she says she's got no appetite
And her father and her mother
And her sisters and her brothers
Couldn't see her when she walked by
You can't see her walk by.

She don't eat no mashed potatoes,
She don't eat no buttered scones
Stay away from carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

She used to be so cuddly,
She used to be so fat,
But oh what a sin cos she's oh so thin
That she lost all the friends that she had,
She looks like skin and bone

If you look flabby
And you feel overweight,
And you wanna lose a couple of stone,
Take a crash course diet do your daily exercises
And you'll look like skin and bone.

Come on rattle them bones,
Put your hands up to the ceiling,
Bend your hips and touch your toes,
Do your daily exercises,
You're gonna look like skin and bone,

Don't eat no mashed potatoes,
Don't eat no buttered scones
Don't eat no carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

Baby Face_EOT
 
I never knew why I loved you so much
Maybe it's the way you look at me when you get up in the morning
I didn't need a shove,
I just fell in love,
With your little baby face

Baby face,
You got the prettiest little baby face
There isn't another one to take your place
Baby face
You got my heart a jumpin'
You sure have started something

Baby face,
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace
I didn't need a shove,
I just fell in love
With your pretty little baby face

You got my heart a-jumpin'
You sure have started something

Baby face,
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace
I didn't need a shove,
I just fell in love
With your pretty little baby face,
Pretty little baby face,
Pretty little baby face.

Lola_EOT
 
I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola [LP version - Coca-Cola:]
C O L A cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L O L A Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walk like a woman but talk like a man
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said little boy won't you come home with me
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me

Well that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Well I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said little boy I'm gonna make you a man

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Preservation_EOT
 
Once upon a time
In a faraway land
Lived a villain called Flash
He was such a wicked man
He terrorized the people
He broke arms and crushed hands
He ruled with a fist and he purchased all the land

Then he plowed up the fields and cut down the trees
For property speculation
And he did it all for a pot of gold
And for his own preservation

The people were scared
They didn't know where to turn
They couldn't see any salvation
From the hoods and the spivs
And the crooked politicians
Who were cheating and lying to the nation

Save the fields and the trees
And give them back to the nation
Bring the government down
A new leader must be found
For the sake of preservation

He said he did it to help us all
And did it for the good of the nation
But he did it for a pot of gold
And for his own preservation

When money is evil
And power is corrupt
The devil moves in and takes over
Mr. Flash broke his word
And now he's got to pay
For his crimes and his lies and his evil ways

And it's gonna get rough
And it's gonna get rough
It's a crime and a sin that no one can win
In a story of self preservation

Daylight_EOT
 
[Sung by Chorus]

Daylight over the Village Green early in the morning.
Daylight over the hills and valleys heralding the morning.
Daylight over the mountains, daylight on the Village Green,
Daylight over the field and the factories.
Another night has gone away and here comes yet another day.

See the early morning risers walking round with bleary eyes.
Worn out housewives grit their teeth ignoring new born babies' cries.
Look at all the busy people this way, that way, everywhere
Biting toast and swallowing tea and breakfast specials on the air.
Feel that daylight.

Feel the sunlight on my pillow and it stops my yawing.
I thank God that I'm still around to see another dawn in.
Daylight over the valleys, daylight lighting up the trees,
Daylight over the hillside,
Smile a smile and sing a song, another night has been and gone.

Middle-aged bankers crack their backs and wish they were young and in their teens,
Lonely spinsters dream of dating Roger Moore or Steve McQueen.
Health fanatics in their attics training for the Empire Games,
School boys dream of Captain Scarlet, battle ships and aeroplanes.

Feel that daylight, Daylight.
Daylight on the Village Green,
Daylight,
Field and the valleys,
Daylight.

Sweet Lady Genevieve_EOT
 
[Sung by The Tramp]

Once under a scarlet sky I told you never ending lies,
But they were the words of a drunken vagabond
Who knew very well he would break your heart before long
Oh forgive me Genevieve.

Now I've come back to see Sweet Lady Genevieve,
This time I'll give you some security
And I will make promises I can keep
So will you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve.

Let me rock you, hold you,
Take you in my arms.
Forgive me, please,
Smile away all your sadness, put your trust in me.

Oh if you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve,
I'm not the impetuous fool you used to know
I know that I used you and I hurt you so,
But that was so long ago Sweet Lady Genevieve.

Oh, love me,
Take me in your arms.
Let me rock you, hold you,
Smile away all your sadness, put your trust in me.

Once under a starry sky I led you on and told you lies
Drank too much whiskey on that hot summer night.
I acted so slyly because you were acting so shy,
Oh forgive me Genevieve.

If you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve,
You're not the child who smiled so innocently
And I'm not the rogue that I used to be,
So will you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve.

Oh Genevieve, Oh Genevieve.

There's A Change In The Weather_EOT
 
[Sung by Working Class Man, Middle Class Man and Upper Class Man]

I'm just a simple working man
Gettin' by the best I can
In this crazy mixed-up muddled-up world that I live in.

I'm a middle class sort of a guy
I'm not rich but I get by
Pretending that I know just what I'm doin'.

I'm a well bred upper class sort of chap,
I don't care much about this and that
Even when I know there's trouble brewin'.

We think there's a change in the weather
We've got to learn to stick together.
We've seen the thunder clouds in the sky,
I wanna live, I don't wanna die.

I think the weather's changing, I hope the weather is gonna change.
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.
I think there's a change in the weather, I hope good weather is here to stay,
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.

See the holocaust risin' over the horizon,
Gonna see a manifestation, total chaos, devastation,
Anticyclone and tornados brewin',
Gonna feel the lightnin' strikin',
Thunder clap smoke a frightnin',

There's gonna be evil doin',
There's trouble brewin',
Everybody scared,
Too much thunder, too much fightin'.

Heavy storm clouds comin',
Gonna cover up the sun
And gonna terrify everyone,
Better pack up your bags and run.

I think there's a change in the weather, I think the weather is going to change.
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.
I think there's a change in the weather, I hope good weather is here to stay.
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.

Where Are They Now?_EOT
 
[Sung by The Tramp]

I'll sing a song about some people you might know
They made front pages in the news not long ago
But now they're just part of a crowd
And I wonder where they all are now.

Where have all the Swinging Londoners gone?
Ossie Clark and Mary Quant
And what of Christine Keeler,
John Stephen and Alvaro,
Where on earth did they all go?
Mr. Fish and Mr. Chow,
Yeah, I wonder where they all are now.

Where are all the Teddy Boys now?
Where are all the Teddy Boys now?
The Brill Cream boys with D.A.s,
Drainpipes and blue suedes,
Beatniks with long pullovers on,
And coffee bars and Ban the Bomb,
Yeah, where have all the Teddy Boys gone?
I hope that Arthur Seaton is alright.
I hope that Charlie Bubbles had a very pleasant flight,
And Jimmy Porter's learned to laugh and smile,
And Joe Lampton's learned to live a life of style.

Where are all the angry young men now?
Where are all the angry young men now?
Barstow and Osborne, Waterhouse and Sillitoe,
Where on earth did they all go?
And where are all the protest songs?
Yes, where have all the angry young men gone.

I wonder what became of all the Rockers and the Mods.
I hope they are making it and they've all got stead jobs,
Oh but rock and roll still lives on,
Yeah, rock and roll still lives on.

One Of The Survivors_EOT
 
[Sung by Johnny Thunder and Chorus]

See Johnny Thunder sitting on his motorbike
Riding along the highway,
Rock and Roll songs from the nineteen-fifties
Buzzing around in his brain.
Johnny Thunder he's one of the original bebop generation
And he's got no time for complicated music or too much sophistication.

He's one of the survivors,
The motorbike riders.
You ought to see Johnny Thunder riding down the highway
One of the rock and roll survivors,
Twelve bars flowing through his brain.
He digs Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and The Belmonts,
And Johnny & The Hurricanes.

He plays Hound Dog, Oh Boy, and Great Balls of Fire
And Boppin' At The High School Hop.
And he's got no time for phonies or posers
'Cos they don't know how to reel and rock.
And he plays Little Egypt and Ooh Poo Pah Doo,
And he plays Poison Ivy and Blue Suede Shoes,
The Hollywood Argyles, Danny & The Juniors,
Dion & The Belmonts, Johnny & The Hurricanes.

He's one of the survivors,
The boppers and the jivers,
Yeah and he rocks all day.
Johnny & The Hurricanes, Johnny & The Hurricanes.

Got my freedom riding along the freeway.
I ride a hundred miles an hour but I don't mess up my D.A.
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.
You can't stop rock 'n' rollin' music play.
([Repeat] last two lines)

Feel those vibrations flow in my brain.
Got my freedom riding down the highway,
Keeps me sane, feel alive,
I'm one of the survivors.

Feel all right.
First gear, second gear, third gear, fourth gear, all right.
Old Johnny Thunder looks a little overweight,
And his sideburns are turning grey.
But he still likes to bebop, boogie and jive
To his worn out seventy-eights.
Johnny Thunder.
He's alright.
He's one of the survivors,
Twelve bars flowing through his brain,
Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion & The Belmonts,
Johnny & The Hurricanes, Johnny & The Hurricanes.

Cricket_EOT
 
[Sung by The Vicar]

Some people say that life is a game, well if this is so
I'd like to know the rules on which this game of life is based.
I know of no game more fitting than the age old game of cricket
It has honour, it has character and it's British.
Now God laid down the rules of life when he wrote those Ten Commandments
And to cricket those ten same rules shall apply.
Show compassion and self-righteousness and be honest above all
And come to God's call with bat and ball.

Now the Devil has a player and he's called the Demon Bowler,
He's shrewd, he's rude and he's wicked.
He is sent by Sinful Satan and he's out to take your wicket
And you know that that's not cricket.
He'll baffle you with googlies with leg breaks and offspin
But keep a level head and don't let that demon in.
So keep a straight bat at all times, let the Bible be your guide
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.

All through your life he'll try to bowl you out
Beware the Demon bowler.
He's crafty and deceitful and he'll try to L.B.W.,
And bowl a maiden over.
The Devil takes the weak in spirit and so we must always be courageous
And remember that God is on your side.
So keep old Satan in your sights and play the straight and narrow line
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.

Money & Corruption / I Am Your Man_EOT
 
We are sick and tired
Of being promised this and that.
We work all day, we sweat and slave
To keep the wealthy fat.
They fill our heads with promises
And bamboozle us with facts,
Then they put on false sincerity
Then they laugh behind our backs.

[Chorus:]
Money and Corruption
Are ruining the land
Crooked politicians
Betray the working man,
Pocketing the profits
And treating us like sheep,
And we're tired of hearing promises
That we know they'll never keep.

[Chorus]

Promises, promises, all we get are promises.
Show us a man who'll understand us, guide us and lead us.

We are sick and tired
Of having to ask them cap in hand
We crawl on the floor
We beg for more,
But still we are ignored.
We're tired of being herded
Like a mindless flock of sheep
And we're tired of hearing promises
That we know they'll never keep.

[Chorus]

We've got to stand together
Every woman, every man,
Because money and corruption are ruining the land.
Show us a man who'll be our Saviour and will lead us.
Show us a man who'll understand us, guide us and lead us.
Show us a man.
Workers of the nation unite.
Workers of the nation unite.

I visualise a day when people will be free
And we'll be living in a new society.
No class distinction, no slums or poverty
I have a vision of a new society.
And every home will have a stereo and TV,
A deep freeze, quadrasonic and a washing machine.
So workers of the nation unite.

I am your man
I'll work out a five-year plan
So vote for me brothers
And I will save this land
And we will nationalise the wealthy companies
And all the directors will be answerable to me,
There'll be no shirking of responsibilities
So people of the nation unite.

Union Man I'll work with you hand in hand
For we're all brothers to our Union Man.
I am your man,
Oh God how I love this land,
So join together save the Fatherland.

I visualize a day when people will be free
And we'll be living in a new society.
No class distinction, no slums or poverty,
So workers of the nation unite,
Workers of the nation unite,
People of the nation unite.

Here Comes Flash_EOT
 
[Sung by Chorus and Scared Housewives]

You'd better run, you'd better fly.
Hide your daughters, hide your wives.
Lock your doors and stay inside
Here comes Flash.

There's no way that you can win,
You must obey his every whim,
Or else he's going to do you in.
Here comes Flash.

He will smile at you, be a friend to you,
Then he's gonna screw you just like that.
He is going to use you, his heavies will abuse you,
And then he's gonna lean on you,
Here comes Flash.

He is gonna rough you up,
Duff you up and touch you up,
And then he's gonna screw you up.
Even though he's mean on you,
There's nothing else that you can do
Just sit back and take his abuse.
He will smile at you, be so sweet to you.
Then he's gonna cheat on you.

You'd better run, you'd better fly.
Hide your daughters, hide your wives.
Lock your doors and stay inside.
Here comes Flash.

Once we loved and trusted him,
Now his thugs and bullies make us live in sin.
They suppress us, oppress us, molest us, possess us.

You'd better run, you'd better fly.
Hide your daughters, hide your wives.
And lock your doors and stay inside.

He will smile at you, be a friend to you,
Then he's gonna screw you just like that.

You'd better run, you'd better fly.
Hide your daughters, hide your wives.
And lock your doors and stay inside.
Here comes Flash.

There's no way that you can win,
You must obey his every whim
Or else he's going to do you in.
Here Comes Flash.
Here Comes Flash.

Sitting In The Midday Sun_EOT
 
[Sung by The Tramp]

I'm sitting by the side of a river
Underneath the pale blue sky
I've got no need to worry, I'm in no hurry
I'm looking at the world go by.

Just sitting in the midday sun,
Just soaking up that currant bun,
With no particular purpose or reason
Sitting in the midday sun.

Everybody say I'm lazy
They all tell me get a job you slob,
I'd rather be a hobo walking round with nothing
Than a rich man scared of losing all he's got.

So I'm just sitting in the midday sun
Just soaking up that currant bun,
Why should I have to give my reasons
For sitting in the midday sun

Oh look at all the ladies
Looking their best in their summer dresses,
Oh sitting in the sun.
I've got no home,
I've got no money
But who needs a job when it's sunny.  Wah Wah.

I haven't got a steady occupation
And I can't afford a telephone.
I haven't got a stereo, radio or video
A mortgage, overdraft, a bank loan.

The only way that I can get my fun
Is by sitting in the midday sun
With no particular purpose or reason
Sitting in the midday sun.

Oh listen to the people,
Say I'm a failure and I've got nothing,
Ah but if they would only see
I've got my pride,
I've got no money,
But who needs a job when it's sunny.  Wah Wah.

Everybody thinks I'm crazy,
And everybody says I'm dumb,
But when I see the people shouting at each other
I'd rather be an out of work bum.

So I'm just sitting in the midday sun
Just soaking up that currant bun,
With no particular purpose or reason
Sitting in the midday sun.

Demolition_EOT
 
[Sung by Flash and his Cronies in their Den]

I spy with my little eye
Anything here that I can buy.
I see a little thatched cottage
Looking so neat
With compulsory purchase we can buy it up cheap.
Then we'll pull up the floor boards,
Knock down the walls,
Rock the foundations,
Until the house falls.
Like a pack of cards,
Crashing to the ground.
Then we'll build a row
Of identical boxes
And sell them all off at treble the profits.
Demolition.

The deeds are in my pocket,
I've got a contract in my hand.
An opportunity for luxury living.
I'll arrange the mortgage
To be repaid a hundred percent.
I can't wait around so make your decision.
We'll buy up all the cottages
And every house and every street,
Until we've got everything we need.
Every town in the vicinity,
Every farm and village green.
We're gonna buy up everything,
Then it's Demolition.
Demolition. Demolition.

Two up, two down,
It hasn't got a garden,
But it's got a lovely patio.
Stainless steel kitchen sink,
Gas fired central heating,
Whaaa - specifically designed for modern-day living,
Nothing's permanent and nothing lasts,
We've sold all the houses so put 'em up fast.
We're gonna buy up this town
And pull it all down.
How I love to hear the demolition sound
Of concrete crashing to the ground.
Demolition.

It's time to make some money,
It's time to get rich quick.
It's the wonderful world of capitalism.
I've got to make a profit,
I've got to satisfy my greed,
It's my faith and my religion,
Demolition. Demolition. Demolition.
And we'll buy up the towns,
And we'll knock 'em all down
Build a brand new world of our own.
[Repeat]

Announcements_EOT
 
"It has been rumored that a new People's Army has been formed by a certain
'Commander Black'.  A few minor incidents have already been reported, and further
Unconfirmed reports suggest that this is a definite attempt to overthrow the
Present government which is led by Mr. Flash.

"We would like to stress that these are only unconfirmed rumors, but we will

Come in.  Meanwhile we do urge the population not to panic and to remain calm
During the crisis."

Please stay tuned to this station for further bulletins.

[Track 5]

[Announcer 1:]
"In just a few moments, Mr. Black is due to address the people.
We are now going over to live coverage of his speech."

[Announcer 2:]
"Well the scenes here are absolutely indescribable.  I've personally
Never seen anything like it before.  A crowd of around, what, thirty-thousand people
Have been waiting all day for the arrival of Mr. Black and his entourage.  And it is
Expected that one of the main topics of his speech this evening will be the controversial
Anti-(something) Corruption Bill, which Mr. Black wants brought into effect immediately
To put an end to the current widespread decline in public moral standards.

"And, just a minute, there he is.  I can see Mr. Black now.  He's surrounded by, of
Course, all his bodyguards.  (something) the crowd is growing wild with excitement -
It's clapping, it's cheering - as Mr. Black finally makes his way on that far side
Onto the platform.  And now - yes, there he is - he's about to speak.

[Track 11]
"News has just reached us of a major victory for Mr. Black and the People's Army.
The battle took place on the outskirts of a small village somewhere in the Northern
Zone.  Casualties on both sides are reported to have been very high, indeed.  And
Our on-the-spot correspondent describes the fighting as some of the fiercest in
Living memory.  No quarter has been shown on either side."

[Track 17]
"At Six A.M. this morning the victorious People's Army overthrew the corrupt regime
That has been ruling over our country.  It is reported that Mr. Flash and his
Gang were all been taken prisoner.  They have been taken to a secret hideout where
They will be tried for treason by a People's Court."

[Track 20]
"A state of emergency was declared by the government at Eight A.M. today.  It was

Emergency measures set out in today's announcement will remain in force for an
Indefinite period.

"Curfew will take effect as from this evening, and will operate between Nine P.M. and

And severe penalties are to be imposed on anyone found on the streets during the
Daily curfew period.

Television channels are now closed down, and radio broadcasts will operate on this
Channel only.

"And now, here is the People's Choir singing the new nation anthem, which led our
Victorious troops into battle!"

Introduction To Solution_EOT
 
[Sung by The Tramp]

While the rich get their kicks with their affluent antics
Mr. Black sits and ponders their fate.
He just sits in the gloom of his dimly-lit room
Waiting for them to swallow the bait.
While the rich run their rackets he sits in his attic
And casually clocks their defeat.
While the politicians cover up mistakes that they've made
And all the promises, the lies and deceits.
A military coup has been long overdue.
Now there's fighting and panic in the streets.
Amid the mass disillusion, disorder and confusion,
He will rise now his plan is complete.
But me, I'm only standing here
Watching it all go on and I'm watching it all go wrong
And it's painfully clear that the battle is near
And I wish I could just disappear.

While Flash and his men drink champagne in their den
And debase life with crude ostentation,
The poor cry for more, but they're reaching the point
Where the people can't stand any more.
But me, I'm only standing here
Watching it all go on, and I'm watching it all go wrong
And it's painfully clear that the battle is near
And I wish I could just disappear.

When A Solution Comes_EOT
 
[Sung by Mr. Black in an attic somewhere in suburbia]

When a solution comes,
It's gonna breathe right down on everyone.
When a solution comes
It's gonna cover up the clouds
And eclipse the sun
And black out a pale blue sky,
And everybody's gonna be terrified,
Because they're all going to feel the bite
And there's going to be a revolution
When a solution comes.
It won't take sides with anyone
Regardless of race or creed,
The whole wide world is gonna feel the squeeze.
The red, black, yellow and white
And even the Arabs and the Israelites
They're all going to feel the bite
And there's going to be a revolution.
I've been searching a long, long time,
Looking for a final solution
Searching here, searching there,
Searching everywhere.
Now my day has finally come
It's time to shout to everyone
I have waited a long, long time,
Biding my time and waiting on the sidelines
Watching it all go wrong.
Witnessing the disintegration,
Rubbing my hands in anticipation.
Everybody's searching so desperately,
They've got to run to someone
And that someone's going to be me.
Yeah, I'm gonna change the world,
I'm going to use a little manipulation.
I'm going to build a new civilisation.

Money Talks_EOT
 
[Scene:]
Into Flash's den - a night club

[Scene:]
In Flash's den, a night club partly converted into an office.

[Sung by Flash, Floosies and Spivs]

Show me a man who says he can live without bread
And I'll show you a man who's a liar and in debt.
There's no one alive who can't be purchased or enticed
There's no man alive who wouldn't sell for a price,
Money talks and we're the living proof,
There ain't no limit to what money can do
Money talks, money talks.

Money can't breathe and money can't see,
But when I pull out a fiver people listen to me.
Money can't run and money can't walk,
But when I write out a cheque I swear to God I hear money talk.
Money talks and, baby, when you've been bought
You pay attention everytime money talks.
Money talks, money talks.

Money talks and there's no doubt about it
Money talks and we can't live without it,
What's the point of living unless you've got money?
I just couldn't function without money.
Money talks, money talks,
Money talks, money talks.

Show me an upright respected man
And I'll have him licking my boots when I put money in his hand.
It rots your heart, it gets to your soul,
Before you know where you are you're a slave to the green gold.
Money talks and we're the living proof
There ain't no limit to what money can do.
Money talks you out of your self-respect,
The more you crave it the cheaper you get.
Money talks, money talks.

Money buys you time and people listen,
Money can buy a smile and make life worth living.
If you're ugly money can improve you.
I just couldn't face the world without mazuma.
Money talks, money talks.

Shepherds Of The Nation_EOT
 
[Sung by Mr. Black The Do-Gooders]

Down with sex and sin,
Down with pot, heroin.
Down with pornography,
Down with lust.
Down with vice lechery and debauchery.

We are the new centurians.
Shepherds of the Nations.
We'll keep on our guard
For sin and degradation.
We are the national guard
Against filth and depravity,
Perversion and vulgarity,
Homosexuality.
Keep it clean.

Down with nudity,
Breasts that are bare and pubic hair.
We are here to cleanse humanity
From the man in the raincoat's
Pale faced glare.
So sodomites beware.

We are the new centurians,
Shepherds of the Nation.
We'll keep on our guard
For sin and degradation.
We are the national, guard
Against filth and depravity,
Perversion and vulgarity,
Homosexuality.
Keep it clean.

I visualise a day when people will be free
From evils like perversion and pornography.
We'll cast out Satan and we'll set the sinners free,
So people of the nation unite.

Put all the pervs in jail,
Bring back the birch, and the cat of nine tails.
Bring back corporal punishment
Bring back the stocks
And the axeman's block.
Let righteousness prevail.

Down with nudity and hard core magazines.
We'll bring religion back
And keep our country clean.
Keep it clean.

We are the new centurians
Shepherds of the Nation.
We'll keep on our guard
For sin and degradation.
We are the national guard
Against filth and depravity.
Perversion and vulgarity,
Homosexuality.
Keep it clean.

Scum Of The Earth_EOT
 
[Sung by Flash, Spivs & Floosies.]

[Flash:]
They call me the scum of the earth.
They say I'm the scab of the nation.
But deep inside I'm only human.
Just an ordinary man.
With ordinary plans.
They say I'm crooked and bent,
They call me a rogue and a villain,
But if they could see deep inside me
They'd see a heart that once was pure
Before it touched the evils of this world,
For if I cut myself I bleed
And if I catch a cold I sneeze.
Have I not eyes to help me see?
Have I not lungs to help me breathe?
Have I not hands, organs, senses
And affections just like you?
Stop the music.
Well ain't I human
Like everybody else?
Before you condemn me my friends,
I suggest that you look deep inside you
For good and evil
Exist in all of us,
And no man is a saint
And each creates his heaven and his hell.

[Chorus:]
We know that he's only a man.
He's got feelings and faults
Just like everyone else.

[Flash:]
So don't put me down because I've done well,
For even wide boys, hoods and spivs
Have got the right to live.

[Chorus]:
We know we're the scum of the earth,
We know we're the scab of the nation,
But we're your enemies and your brothers
And no man is a saint
And deep down we're all the same as one another.

Second-Hand Car Spiv_EOT
 
[Sung by Spiv, Flash & Floosies]

Spiv:   I was born a slum gutter infantile,
Brute-force educated, delinquent juvenile.
I am a product of mass produced factory fodder,
Streets full of tenement blocks, rat infested filth and squalor.
I left school, went straight on the dole
And unemployment's no enjoyment,
Welfare State owned my mind and my body and my soul.
So I worked my way up to be a second-hand car spiv,
But don't judge me harshly because I'm just a slum kid.
I built up my business with a quick wit and fist,
So don't double-cross me or my hoods will dissect you
With their black jacks and shiv.
Slum kids never get a break, they've got to fight their way up.
Wheel and deal, beg and steal,
Sweat blood to earn a buck.
I didn't want to work on the factory floor,
I wasn't content, I wanted more
Than to be a slave of a lathe,
Work all day and go home bored.
So a second- hand car spiv was what I became.
I built an empire because I used my brains.

[Chorus:] He was a second-hand car spiv up from the slums,
So don't judge him harshly because he's just a slum kid.
Then he moved into property, stocks and shares,

Spiv:   And into high finance and you've got to agree
That running a multi-million corporation
Sure beats selling cars second-hand.

[Chorus:] Once he sold old worn out heaps to the punters on the street,

Spiv:   Now I'm in control of the country as a whole,
And the world is at my feet.

[Chorus:] The world is at his feet.

Spiv:   Power, power, I've got power oozing out of me,
And when you think of all the things I've done
It says a lot for one
Who worked his way up from the streets.
Yes I'm a second-hand car spiv.
Do a deal, buy and sell,
It's my trade, I know it well.
Make a sale, ring the bell
And let the suckers go to hell.
Bank the profits, count the change
Another sucker comes your way.
Life is a crooked game,
And slum kids never change.

He's Evil_EOT
 
[Scene: A party political broadcast - Mr. Black and his followers]

He comes on smooth, cool and kind,
But he wants your body not your mind.
He's got style, personality,
But he's the devil in reality.
He'll make you laugh, make you smile,
And make you feel good for a while.
Wicked smile, decadent grin,
He likes school girls, nuns and virgins.
His skin is soft but his mind is hard,
He'll lead you on then he'll tear you apart.
He'll treat you rough and he will make you cry,
And you will kiss sweet innocence good-bye.
And once you're in there'll be no getting out,
So look out, look out, look out, look out.
He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil.
He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil.

He's got wit he's got charm.
But when he gets rough he'll break your arm.
He's got taste, manners and grace,
But when he gets tough he'll slit your face.
He'll buy you jewels, expensive clothes,
Then his mind'll go and he'll bust your nose.
He's a joker and a clown
But he'll pervert you and drag you down.
He comes on smooth, cool and kind,
But he wants your body not your mind,
He is just the devil in disguise.
He will drag you down and he will make you cry,
And once you're in there will be no getting out.
So look out, look out, look out.
Look out, look out, look out.
He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil.
He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil.

Mirror Of Love_EOT
 
Why I love you though you treat me bad.
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
Oh the mirror of love and you look alright,
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
You're such a cool lover,
But you're such a cruel lover,
Treat me like I'm a fool,
I hate you but you know I would kill for you.
You're a mean and obscene lover,
But I would have no other,
Even though you treat me bad,
You were the best man I ever had,
'Cos through the mirror of love, mirror of love,
When I see you through the mirror of love,
You're alright and I forget that you're bad,
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.

Why I love you though you treat me bad,
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
The mirror of love you sure look alright.
I see your reflection when I'm looking through the mirror of love.
You're a crude and a rude lover,
But I would have no other,
You slap me down, treat me bad,
You're a two-timing swine and you drive me mad.
You're a mean and obscene lover,
But you are my dream lover,
'Cos even though you treat me bad,
You were the best man I ever had,
'Cos through the mirror of love, mirror of love,
I see your reflection in the mirror of love.
And you're alright though you treat me bad.
When I see you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
Oh the mirror of love, sure look alright
'Cos when I see you I'm looking through the mirror of love.

Nobody Gives_EOT
 
[Sung by The Tramp]

I can't understand why everybody's quarreling,
Nobody gives in case they lose face,
And everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent,
And the fact of it is nobody gives any more.

It's the same throughout all history,
Nobody gives unless they receive,
And nobody trusts or is willing to believe
And nobody gives or is willing to concede.

Back in nineteen hundred and twenty-five
There were thousands of people struggling to survive.
There was hunger, unemployment and poverty,
Then in 1926 they decided to be free
So they all went on strike and
The workers told the unions, who blamed it on the government,
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants,
Everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent,
But the fact of it is nobody gives any more.

Back in nineteen hundred and thirty-nine
There were scores of German military waiting in a line,
And the Fatherland wanted what the world wouldn't give,
And then Hitler decided he could take what was his,
So they all went to war and said
Kill all the left-wing intellectuals,
Annihilate the Jews and wipe out their race,
Eliminate the weak because they're ineffectual,
And the fact of it is nobody gives any more.

I'm only sitting here watching it all go on
And listening to both sides.
Yeah, why can't we talk it out,
Why can't we sort it out,
We'll work it out if we try.
Why can't we sit down and work out a compromise,
Why not negotiate and try to be civilised?
I'll tell you why, because nobody gives a damn.
Nobody listens and no one will understand.
Yet I'm wondering, sitting here wondering,
And listening to both sides.
Why can't we work it out?
Why can't we sort it out?
We'll work it out if we try.
Why can't we sit down and work out a compromise,
Why not negotiate and try to be civilised?
I'll tell you why, because nobody gives a damn.
Nobody listens and no one will understand.
Yet, I'm wondering, sitting here wondering,
Yet I'm wondering, sitting here wondering
Listening to both sides.
Nobody gives, nobody gives, nobody gives.

The workers told the unions who blamed it on the government,
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants,
Everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent.

Nobody gives. Nobody gives a damn any more.
The politicians, unions, workers and the militants,
The fact of it is nobody gives any more.

Oh Where Oh Where Is Love?_EOT
 
[Sung by: The Tramp and the Do-Gooders]

In a world full of jive,
Full of homicide and suicide,
There's no room for love and romance.
In a world full of spite
Full of hatefulness and bitterness,
Sincerity don't stand a chance.
And every night I close my eyes
And ask the stars above,
Oh where, oh where, oh where, oh where is love?

Where is love and romance,
And appreciation of storybooks, fairytales
And the ordinary things people did long ago.
Where did it go?
Where is love?
Where is hope?
Where is sympathy and trust?
Where is faith?
Where is joy in simplicity?
And where is regard and respect?
Oh where, oh where is love?
This world is spinning and turning
And my head is full of learning,
But my thoughts keep on returning
To the things I used to know.
I should be stronger,
But my mind continually wanders
And deep inside
A voice keeps crying
Where, oh where is love?

Where is love and romance,
And appreciation of storybooks, fairytales,
And the ordinary things people did long ago?
Where did it go?
In a world full of jive,
Full of homicide and suicide,
There's no room for love and romance.
In a world full of rape,
Full of hatefulness and bitterness,
Sincerity don't stand a chance.
And every night I close my eyes
And ask the stars above,
Oh where, oh where, oh where, oh where is love?
Where oh where is love?
Where is Love?
Where is hope?
Where is sympathy and trust?
Where is faith?
Where is joy and simplicity
And where is regard and respect?
Oh where, oh where is love?
Oh where oh where is love?
Oh where oh where is love?

Flash's Dream (The Final Elbow)_EOT
 
[Scene:]  Mr. Black's army is closing in on Flash & The Spivs.
After a long day's campaigning Flash, having overindulged
The alcohol, has fallen asleep in his den.

[Voice:]  Cooee. Cooee. Flash. Flash

[Flash:]  Who is this?

[Voice:]  Wake up Flash.  Can you hear me Flash?

[Flash:]  Who is this?  Who dares to wake me from my slumber?

[Voice:]  Need I announce myself?  Am I such a stranger to you?

[Flash:]  Say your name.  Speak!

[Voice:]  I am your soul.

[Flash:]  My soul?

[Voice:]  I have come to show you who you are.

[Flash:]  Show me who I am?  I know who I am you upstart!  How
Dare you intrude.

[Voice:]  You lied and schemed and took over a simple village and
Turned it into a vulgar playground for your own money-
Making ends. Before you came people lived simple lives.
This was a happy place. Then you ploughed up the fields,
Sold off the land and lined your own pockets with the profits.

[Flash:]  Lies!  Lies!  I did it to help the nation

[Voice:]  You did it for your own preservation!

[Flash:]  No!  No!

[Voice:]  Prepare yourself Flash, there are many who suffered at your
Hands. They are craving for vengeance. Time is running out.

[Flash:]  Can this be the end?  Can this be the swan song?  The final
Elbow?  I will not go. The people need me.

[Voice:]  Men like you will always come and go, but the people will go
On forever.  Take one final look at the past Flash.  Enjoy it,
Because you have no future.

[Flash:]  No!  No!  No!  I can't stand this.

Trumpets herald the final confrontation between Flash and himself.

Flash's Confession_EOT
 
I've just had a dream that I never will forget.
And I wish I could erase.
I was standing on the street with a whole crowd of people
And no one knew my name.
And I was just another face
No one looked at me or touched me
Spoke to or acknowledged me.
I had no identity or individuality
No thoughts of my own, no mind or personality.
I was just a no one, a total nonentity
I'm just a number waiting to be called.
It is time for confessing it all,
I'm just another face,
Yes, it's time for confessing it all.

Been a cheat, been a crook,
Never gave I always took.
Crushed people to acquire
Anything that I desired.
Been deceitful and a liar
Now I'm facing Hell Fire.
I can't believe that my time has come
For confessing all the evil
And the wrong that I've done.
The reckoning's come
And now I'm just a no one.
I confess to the timid and the meek
To the cripples and the beggars
And the tramps in the street.
I confess my cruelty, my ego and conceit.
I've opened up my body and looked inside
And I'm everything that I once despised.
I confess for the thieves,
The affected and deranged,
I confess for the muggers and incurably insane.
I confess to the ugly for being vain,
I confess to those I hurt for causing them pain.
I'm just a number
Waiting to be called
And it's time for confessing it all,
And I'm just another face,
And it is time for confessing it all,
Yes, it's time for confessing it all,
Yes, it's time for confessing it all.

Nothing Lasts Forever_EOT
 
[Scene:]
Flash is on the run and he goes to Belle for help.
He sings this song with Belle.

[Flash:]
When we were young and green
We shared our dreams together,
And you were my friend.

[Belle:]
We had our good times pal,
We thought they'd last forever.
But nothing lasts forever,
Nothing lasts forever.
Time goes by and people change
It's best we go our separate ways
And it was wrong to think our love would never end
My friend
Nothing lasts forever,
Nothing lasts forever.
Time goes by it takes us all,
Nations crumble and empires fall
And who are we
To think that we would always be,
You see nothing lasts forever,
Nothing lasts forever.

[Flash:]
I know that you'll survive
And you'll get by whatever.
Though you say goodbye.
My love will never die,
It will last forever.

Your love will die but mine will last forever,
Your love will fade but mine will last forever.
Your feeling might go but mine will last forever.
And though you're gone you're in my mind forever.

Artificial Man_EOT
 
[Scene:]    After his capture, Flash is taken to a secret hideout to have
His brain cleansed, and his mind conditioned.
Flash, Mr. Black and the Mad Scientist sing_EOT
 
[Flash:]    I can't believe it's happening
I just want to stay the way that I am.
I don't want to live a lie in an artificial world.

[Mr. Black:] Let's build an antiseptic world,
Full of artificial people.
Cure all diseases, conquer pain
And monitor the human brain,
And see what thoughts you're thinking.
Observe your feelings,
Secret fears,
Controlling everything you say and do
And we will build a master race
To live within our artificial world.
Tell it to the people all across the land,
We're going to build an artificial man
With the physique of a Tarzan
And the profile of a Cary Grant,
A superior being
Totally made by hand.
Throw out imperfection,
Mould you section by section,
Gonna make you the ultimate creation.

[Flash:]    I can visualise the day
When the world will be controlled by artificial people,
But I don't want to live a lie in an artificial world.

[Mr. Black:] Tell the world that we finally did it,
Made a man that's totally programmed,
Preconditioned thoughts and emotions,

Push-button artificial man.
Did you ever want to live forever?
Well here's your chance to be a total automaton
'Cos we've improved on God's creation
An outdated homo sapien.
Make you taller if you want it
Make your hair grow longer if you need it.
If it doesn't exist then I guess we can breed it.
There'll be no disagreements,
We'll dedicate our lives to achievements,
And organise your life and keep it totally planned.

[Flash:]    I can visualise the day
When the world will be controlled by artificial people,
But I don't want to live a lie in an artificial world.

[Mr Black]  Tell the world we finally did it.
[& Mad]     Modified the population,
[Scientist:] Put your senses and your mind
Under constant observation
Even when you're dreaming.
Replaced your nose, heart and lungs,
So shake me with your artificial hand.
We went and built a master race
To live within our artificial world.

Scrapheap City_EOT
 
There ain't no beauty
And there ain't no style,
There's no quality
And there's no purity.
Honour's dead and buried
Because it's unnecessary.

Look at all the people,
Why they all look the same.
They're walking to the factory
In their cloth caps and trilbies.
They've got no style,
Ain't it a pity.

They're tearing old quality down
Without any pity,
Now they're coming to take me away
To Scrapheap City.
They say that good manners belong on a heap,
They say they're outdated and they're obsolete,
And now they're coming to take me away
To Scrapheap City.

There's no quality
And there ain't no style
Just miles and miles
Of Scrapheap piles.
There's no quality
And there's no purity.
They're digging up all of the flowers
Because they look pretty
And erecting identical concrete monstrosities.
They're killing off all of the animals too,
The only ones left are the ones in the zoo.
Now they're coming to take me away
To Scrapheap City.
Ain't it a pity,
Scrapheap City.

Salvation Road_EOT
 
Hear me brothers, hear me sisters,
Citizens and comrades hear my song.
The old life's dead the order's changing
It's time for all of us to move along.

Got no time to live a life
With old worn-out traditions
Swallowed my pride,
Changed my ways,
And found a new religion.
There you go.

Sick and tired of living on loans,
Driving around in a car that I don't own.
Tired of looking at wealthy faces
Flying off to far out places.
The workers of the world
Shall give the profits to the people.
Class will disappear
And we will live our lives as equals.
There you go.

And we'll all walk along
And we'll all sing a song
And we'll all mark time as we go.
Yes, we'll all walk along
And we'll all sing a song
As we walk down Salvation Road.

Goodbye youth, goodbye dreams,
The good times and the friends I used to know.
Goodbye freedom, hello fear,
A brave new world has suddenly appeared.
Got to be hard,
Don't look back
And no more reminiscing.
Times are rough,
We've got to be tough,
And concentrate on living.
There you go.

And we'll all join hands,
And we'll all march along
And we'll all mark time as we go.
Yes, we'll all walk along,
And we'll sing a song,
As we walk down Salvation Road.

We'll all walk along
And we'll all sing a song
And we'll all mark time as we go.
Yes, we'll all walk along
And we'll all sing a song
As we walk down Salvation Road.

Mirror Of Love_EOT
 
Why I love you though you treat me bad.
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
Oh the mirror of love and you look alright,
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
You're such a cool lover,
But you're such a cruel lover,
Treat me like I'm a fool,
I hate you but you know I would kill for you.
You're a mean and obscene lover,
But I would have no other,
Even though you treat me bad,
You were the best man I ever had,
'Cos through the mirror of love, mirror of love,
When I see you through the mirror of love,
You're alright and I forget that you're bad,
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.

Why I love you though you treat me bad,
'Cos when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.
The mirror of love you sure look alright.
I see your reflection when I'm looking through the mirror of love.
You're a crude and a rude lover,
But I would have no other,
You slap me down, treat me bad,
You're a two-timing swine and you drive me mad.
You're a mean and obscene lover,
But you are my dream lover,
'Cos even though you treat me bad,
You were the best man I ever had,
'Cos through the mirror of love, mirror of love,
I see your reflection in the mirror of love.
And you're alright though you treat me bad.

Oh the mirror of love, sure look alright
'Cos when I see you I'm looking through the mirror of love.

Slum Kids_EOT
 
We're just slum kids, and we know it,
And we never stood a chance.
We were dragged up from the gutter,
From the wrong side of the tracks.

So how dare you criticize,
When you don't know what it's like
To be dragged up from the gutter,
From the wrong side of the tracks.

Why do rich kids get all the breaks,
While the poor slum kids have to work, sweat, struggle and slave?
Why, Lord, there's so much injustice in this world?
Slum kids never stand a chance.

Look at all the slum kids all around you,
Oh, they never stood a chance.
We were dragged up from the gutter,
From the wrong side of the tracks.

Everybody's A Star (Starmaker)_EOT
 
I am a creator,
Inventor and innovator.
I observe the people,
The ordinary people
No matter what your occupation is
Everybody's in showbiz.
'Cos I'm a Star (gonna make you a star),
And I can make you a Star (gonna make you a star),
I believe that everybody's a celebrity,
And we've all got personality
And individuality.
We all read lines,
And we all act a part,
We all need a script
And an audience to play to.
No matter what you do,
Or who you are,
Everybody's a star.

I'm the magic maker,
I'm the image maker,
I'm the interior decorator.

I can take any man
I see standing in the road
And put rouge on his cheeks
And put some powder on his nose.
I'll teach him how to act,
I'll remould and reshape him.
I'll put him in a stage suit
And I'll teach him how to pose.
I can turn the most ordinary man in the world into a star.
I'm a starmaker (gonna make you a star),
Yes, I'm gonna make you a star (gonna make you a star)
No matter how dull or simple you are
Everybody's a star.

I'm the magic maker,
I'm the image maker,
I can make or break you.
L'm a star maker (gonna make you a star)
Yes, I'm gonna make you a star (gonna make you a star),
Gonna make you a star,
'Cos everybody's a star.

Ordinary People_EOT
 
[Star:]
I am the image maker.  I am the magic
Maker. I can turn the most ordinary
Man in the world into a star.  To prove
My point I am going to find the most
Mundane little man and turn him into
Celebrity.  Hmm!  This looks like a
Suitably uninteresting house.  I wonder
If there's anybody here with enough
Star quality?

He presses the doorbell.

[Star:]
Hello.  What's your name?

[Wife:]
Andrea.

[Star:]
Oh, that's a nice name. What's your
Husband's name?

[Wife:]
Norman.

[Star:]
His name's Norman.  That sounds
Ordinary enough.  I would like you to
Join in a unique experiment with me.
I am going to take Norman's place for
A few days.  I 'm going to research his
Ordinary dull little existence.

[Wife:]
Oh you can't come in now!  The place
Is in a terrible mess!

[Star:]
That doesn't matter.  I want you to act
Normally.  I want you to treat me as if I
Were Norman.  I am going to sacrifice
My normal flamboyant life style and
Become ordinary, boring little Norman
For a few days.

Ordinary People

It's like another world, being here with you,
It's quite a trip for me, so this is reality.
I'm studying every movement, I'm trying to learn the part,
Now I want you to be natural, just relax and be as you are,
'Cos it's all for art, I want to observe the ordinary people

Tomorrow I shall become Norman,
I shall go to his office,
Mix with his workmates.
And if they ask any questions
I shall say I'm doing research for one of my songs.
Nomand and I are changing places
And I'm going to make him a star,
So I'm throwing away my stage suit and I'm packing away my guitar,
For the sake of art I'm gonna mix with the ordinary people.

[Star:]
God these pyjamas are awful!

[Wife:]
Awful?  Well all I can say is my Norman wears them every night.

[Star:]
Alright, no sacrifice is too great for art!

The things I've done for music,
The things I've done for art.
So I'll make these sacrifices and I'll take it like a star
For the sake of art I will mix with the ordinary people.

[Star:]
You'd better come to bed darling.

[Wife:]
Coming!  You'll never get up for work in the morning.

I'm making observations, and character simulations.
I'll mix with his friends and relations,
And he'll be a part of me.

[Chorus]
He's changing places with Norman,
To get background for his songs.

I'm immortalising his life
And I'll even sleep with his wife,
For the sake of art I'll go to bed like the ordinary people.

Turn out the light.
Turn out the light.

The Star exchanges his silver stage
Suit for Norman's pin stripe suit,
Umbrella and briefcase.  He forsakes
His customary brandy and cigars and
Settles for a cup of hot chocolate before
Going to bed.

[Live version:]
Hey Norman, you're stayin' at home with your wife
And you dream you're a rock-n-roll star
But you've reached the point of no return
And you don't know who you really are
You're livin' in a fantasy world
You don't know what's real
How does it feel, all of your life
In an enchanted lie[?] [could be "eternal lie"?]

[Or possibly it's "Imitating lives of... the ordinary people"]

The ordinary people
The ordinary people
The ordinary people

Hey mister can you lend me a hand
Can you tell me who I really am
Am I just an ordinary guy
Or do I play in a rock-n-roll band
Are you all in my imagination
Are they only in my mind
'Cause I just don't know what to feel
When everything seems real

With the ordinary people
The ordinary people
The ordinary people

Rush Hour Blues_EOT
 
He gets up early about seven o'clock,
The alarm goes off and then the house starts to rock.
In and out of the bathroom by seven-o-three,
By seven-ten he's downstairs drinking his tea.
So put a shine on your shoes,
Put on your pin-striped suit.
Can't lose those early-morning-can't-stop-yawning,
Push and shoving rush hour blues.

[Wife:]
Darling are you ready?
You'll be late for the bus!

[Star:]
Don't rush me baby
While I'm using my brush.

[Wife:]
Get a move on darling
You're cutting it fine.

[Star:]
Cool it baby
I've got plenty of time.

So put a shine on your shoes
Put on your pin-striped suit.
Can't lose those early-morning-can't-stop-yawning
Push and shoving rush hour blues.

Soon I'll be just one of the commuters
Waiting for the subway train.
I'll be rushing up the stairs
And in the elevator.
By the time that I get there
I'm gonna feel like a mole in the ground
I'll be caught in the crush
I'll be pushed and be shoved,
And I'll be trying to get the subway train.
I'll be fighting with my brief case
And my umbrella,
Every morning and every night.
Some people do it every day of their lives.

[Wife:]
Read the paper later
You'll be caught in the queues.

[Star:]
Don't rush me baby
While I'm reading the news.

[Wife:]
Darling get a move on
You're cutting it fine.

[Star:]
Cool it baby
I've got plenty of time.

A quick cup of coffee and a slice of
Toast and the Star (or should we say,
Norman?) is off to do battle with the
Rush hour queues and traffic jams.

In the rush hour queues
No one gives a damn.
No one knows where I'm going to
No one knows who I am.

I'm sitting in my office
In the metropolis
I'm just part of the scenery,
I'm just part of the machinery.
Chained to my desk on the 22nd floor,
I can't break out through the automatic door,
I'd jump out the window but I can't face the drop
I'm sitting in a cage with an eye on the clock.

I'm ready to start paying my dues,
I've got to lose those early-morning-can't-stop-yawning,
Push and shoving, rush hour blues.

Well I'm ready to start paying my dues,
I've got to lose those early-morning can't-stop-yawning,
Push and shoving rush hour blues.

Nine To Five_EOT
 
The Star is in Norman's office.  His day
Of sweat and toil has begun.

Nine To Five

Answering phones and dictating letters
Making decisions that affect no one.
Stuck in the office from nine until five
Life is so incredibly dull,
Working from nine to five.

Oh nine to five, nine to five,
Working from nine to five.

And time goes by
The hours tick away.
First seconds,
Then minutes,
Then hours into days.
Each day,
Each week,
Seems just like any other.
All work,
No play,
It's just another day.

He's caught in a mass of computerised trivia,
Deciphering data for mechanical minds.
He's lost in the paperwork and up to his eyes,
He's checking a list that's been checked out before
And he's starting to lose his mind.

Oh nine to five, nine to five,
Working from nine to five.
[Repeat].

When Work Is Over_EOT
 
When work is over he likes to hit the bars,
And at the boozer we'll have another jar,
Because drinking can help ease the strain
Of his boring occupation,
Dull conversation,
Living by the book
And the rules and regulations.

Drinking helps us to forget what we are,
We leave the office and walk straight to the bar.
Don't stop to think,
Have another drink!

Drinking helps us to relax with the chaps,
A double scotch and we forget where we're at.
Don't stop to think
Have another drink!

When work is over he likes to hit the bars,
Go down the boozer and have another jar,
Because drinking can help ease the strain
Of his boring occupation,

Boring occupations,
Dull conversations,
Living by the book
And the rules and regulstions.

Have Another Drink_EOT
 
Has everybody got problems?
Are you stuck in a deadend job?
Frustrated and dissatisfied?
Are you on the edge of suicide?
Terrorist bombers on the left,
Fascist plots on the right.
Mass destruction and homicide,
Are you horrified and terrified?
Such a shame.

We've all got problems we know,
There's one thing that's for sure,
There's only one cure for all your hangups and all your depressions.

Have another drink it'll make you feel better,
Have another drink and you'll feel alright.
If you feel down and you're under the weather
Have another drink and you'll feel alright.
[Repeat]

Facts and figures.
Filling out forms.
Reading circulars.
Dictating letters.
Is your occupation
Getting to your brain?
Is there no relief?
It's like a ball and chain.
There's no need to get depressed,
Worrying won't make it better.
There's only one consolation I can recommend.
Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself.

Have another drink and you'll feel alright.
Have another drink it'll make you feel better.
Have another drink and you'll feel alright.
Have another drink it'll make you feel better.
Have another drink and you'll feel alright.

If you're feeling down and you're under the weather,
Have another drink and you'll feel alright.
Have another drink it'll make you feel better,
Have another drink and you'll feel alright.

If you're feeling down and under the weather,
Have another drink and you'll feel alright.

Underneath The Neon Sign_EOT
 
Our hero leaves the pub his head still
Swimming with alcohol, his head
Buzzing with facts, figures and
Computers.  Night is descending as he
Wearily makes his way home through
The traffic jams and neon lights of the
Great metropolis.

Underneath The Neon Sign

All I see is imitation
And there's no earth beneath my feet.
There are no trees or fields in front of me
Only slabs of concrete.
Skyscrapers reaching up to the clouds,
Don't give the moon a chance to shine,
And I've got imitation moonlight
Standing underneath the neon sign.

Is it real or just illusion?
Can there be day-time when it's night?
Is it merely my delusion
Or are my senses telling me lies.
Is it just hallucination?
Have I been drinking too much wine?
I don't know if it's day or night,
When I'm underneath the neon sign.
Underneath the neon sign.

Electronic nature made by man with robots in mind.
Big city lights guide my way into the night, darkness shines
When I'm standing underneath the neon sign.

If there isn't any sunshine
We'll sunbathe by the neon sign
And if we can't see any stars at night
We'll sit and watch the traffic lights.
If there isn't any day-time
I've got an imitation dawn,
I've got a simulated sunshine
Standing underneath the neon sign.

Is it only an illusion?
Have I been drinking too much wine?
Can there be day-time when it's night
Underneath the neon sign.
Underneath the neon sign.
Is it mother nature
Playing tricks with my eyes
For darkness shines
When I'm standing underneath the neon sign.

Holiday Romance_EOT
 
On the subway train he sees adverts
For holidays in Jamaica, a weekend in
Rome, a cruise round the
Mediterranean, and dreams of a quiet
Week in a little seaside resort away
From his wife, the ducks on the wall,
The soap operas, the office and his
Friends - and who knows, he might
Encounter a holiday romance.

Holiday Romance

I had a break for a week
So I booked my seat
And confirmed a reservation
At a quiet little seaside hotel.
I packed my bags
And I caught my train and
Reached my destination
Just in time for the dinner gong-ding dong.
Then I saw Lavinia
Standing at the bottom of the stairs.
And I fell for Lavinia
The moment that I saw her standing there.

Lavinia looked so divine
As she walked up to the table to dine
And then Lavinia's eyes met mine.

I thought can this be love,
Can this be lovey-dove
Or just a holiday romance?
Can this be long lost love at last
Or is it just a flash in the pan?

Then after cheese and liqueurs they struck up the band,
I plucked up my courage and I asked Lavinia to dance
That was the start of my holiday romance.
Just a holiday romance.

We did the foxtrot, samba and danced through the night
The last waltz came and we held each other so tight.
That was the start of my holiday romance.

Just a holiday romance
A simple holiday romance.
I wonder should I take a chance?

We walked on the beach,
And we paddled our feet,
And we watched all the swimmers,
And my holiday treat felt complete.
We drank lemonade,
And we sat in the shade,
I thought I must be on a winner
And I acted cool and discreet.
For I knew that Lavinia
Was the shyest lady that I'd ever met,
And I knew that Lavinia
Would only be my lady for the week.

It was just a holiday romance
A simple holiday romance.
I wonder should I take this chance?
Just a holiday romance.

Can this be love,
Can this be lovey-dove
Or just a holiday romance?

I tried to kiss her, she walked away,
She said "Better stop, my husband's
Coming to collect me today".
That was the end of my holiday,
Sweet and innocent holiday,
End of my holiday romance.

You Make It All Worthwhile_EOT
 
He arrives home. He fumbles in his
Pockets for his keys but there is no
Need.  Andrea is waiting to greet him
With open arms.

[Wife:]
Hello love.  You look all worn out!
Let me take your brief case.  That's a
Good boy.  Now you come and sit down
Ouer here and relax and I'll make you
A nice cuppa tea.  Then we'll have
Dinner and we can sit and watch the
Tele.  By the way dear, how'd you get
On at the office.

You Make It All Worthwhile

I mustn't stay in this job too long
I gotta get out before the hold is too strong
Gotta get out before my ambition is gone
'Cos it's breaking me up and bringing me down.

But when I get home you make it all worthwhile,
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day sorting out the files
You make it all worthwhile.

[Wife:]
Oh, I've just remembered we've only got shepherd's pie,
Do you like it?

[Star:]
No, I hate it.

[Wife:]
Hate it?  But you see Norman loves it so much and you did ask me to
Act normally, didn't you.  I mean I can't cope with all that
Fancy stuff you like to eat.

[Star:]
Alright, I'll eat it and afterwards, I'll write a whole verse about
Your cooking.

You mustn't blame yourself like you do,
It's gonna make a nervous wreck out of you,
So wipe your nose and dry your eyes,
What's the point of cracking up all because of shepherd's pie?

Baby, you never know what I've been through.
I break my back and sweat and slave
To bring some money home to you.
Baby, you won't believe it but it's true
What a boring occupation can do,
It can make a nervous wreck out of you,
It can kill your spirit and destroy your mind.

But when I get home you make it all worthwhile.
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day sorting out the files
You make it all worthwhile.

[Wife:]
Would you like steam pudding and custard for afters.

[Star:]
Darling, that would be marvellous.

And when I come home you make it all worthwhile.
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day working on the files
You make it all worthwhile

[Star:]
Come on darling, let's go and have dinner.

And when I come home you make it all worthwhile.
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day working on the files
You make it all worthwhile.

Ducks On The Wall_EOT
 
After dinner Norman becomes depressed.

[Star:]
Norman's office got on my nerves to-day.

[Wife:]
What do you mean?  You are Norman!

[Star:]
(Shouts) I am a star!

[Wife:]
You're not a star Norman.  You're
Just a plain ordinary little bloke and
Even if you walked down the street in
A silver suit people still wouldn't
Recognise you.  You're dull, ordinary
And uninteresting!  You're a drag!

Star rises from his chair and smashes
The dinner plates to the floor.

[Star:]
I hate this house and I hate you, but
More than anything else I hate those
Ducks!

[Wife:]
Don't you touch those ducks Norman!
They were a present from my mother.
Look, Norman, I've had enough of you
And your ridiculous fantasies.  First of
All you wanted to be a painter, then
You wanted to be an astronaut, then
A footballer and now you're playing at
Being a rock singer.  If you touch those
Ducks I'm leaving!

Ducks On The Wall

My baby's got the most deplorable taste,
But her biggest mistake
Is hanging over the fireplace.
She's got ducks, ducks on the wall,
Ducks, ducks, hanging on the wall.

My lady's got a sort of strange fascination,
An obsessive fixation
For cheap decorations
She's got ducks, ducks on the wall.
Ducks, ducks, hanging on the wall.

Wo-wo-wo I love her so but if she doesn't move the ducks,
I think my mind is gonna go.
Ducks ducks on the wall.
Ducks ducks, hanging on the wall.

I leave the office and I want to relax.
Don't want to stare at a wall
And look at a duck that can't quack.
I love you baby but I can't fall
For those ducks on the wall.

I start to snuggle up and squeeze her so tight.
Then out of the corner of my eye
I see those ducks in flight.
I love you baby but I can't ball
When I see those ducks on the wall.

Wo-wo-wo I can sit through your gossip and your soap opera shows,
But those ducks have got to go.
I love you baby but I can't ball
When I see those ducks on the wall.
And when I went to a cocktail party
With the bores next door,
What was the first thing that I saw?
Ducks, ducks on the wall.
Ducks, ducks hanging on the wall.

My baby's got the most deplorable taste,
But her biggest mistake
Is hanging over the fireplace.
She's got ducks, ducks on the wall,
Ducks, ducks hanging on the wall.

I'll sit and look at all the soap operas with her
I'll play all the panel games and watch all the quiz shows,
But those ducks they've got to go,
Those ducks are getting up my nose.

If those ducks can fly, well so can I.
And if those ducks have got to stay
Then I'm going to fly away.
I love you baby but I can't ball
When I see those ducks on the wall.

Ducks, ducks, ducks on the wall.
Ducks, ducks, ducks on the wall.
Oh those ducks on the wall are beginning to move
They're talking to me
I've got to get away from those ducks.

(A) Face In The Crowd_EOT
 
Our Star doesn't know who he is any
More.  Is he the starmaker, the image
Maker, looking for material or is he
Just plain boring little Norman after
All?  Perhaps he should accept that he
Is a plain ordinary bloke and not try to
Be something he is not.

(A) Face In The Crowd

I've got to stop faking it,
I've got to start facing it,
I'm going to take my final bow
Then I'm going to take my place in the crowd.
I know I'll get used to it,
I've got to stop acting like a clown.

I've gotta start facing up to what I really am.
I've got to realise l'm just an ordinary man.
I think that I'll just settle down
And take my place in the crowd.
I don't want to lie to myself any more.

Am I just a face in the crowd, is that all I'll ever be?
Don't want to be anything that isn't really me.
Mister, can you tell me who I am?
Do you think I stand out
Or am I just a face in the crowd?

You Can't Stop The Music_EOT
 
And so Norman decides to stop living
Out his fantasy of being a rock star and
Accept reality.  This is the end for
Norman but not for us because there
Will always be someone ready to take
His place - after all, euerybody's a
Star!

You Can't Stop The Music

Let's all raise a glass
To the rock stars of the past,
Those that made it,
Those that faded,
Those that never even made the grade,
Those that we thought would never last.

Singers come and go,
And stars fade away.
They vanish in the haze
And they're never seen again,
But the music just keeps playing on.

They can't stop the music,
They can't stop the music,
They can't stop the music playing on.

I've been half a million places,
I've seen half a million people who stare,
I've been a star and down and out,
I've been put on, sat on, punched and spat on,
They've called me a faggot, a spiv and a fake,
They can knock me down and tread on my face,
They can't stop the music playing on.

Let's all raise a glass
To the rock stars of the past,
Those that made it,
Those that faded,
Those that never even made the grade,
Those that we thought would never last.

Singers come and go,
And stars fade away.
They vanish in the haze
And they're never seen again,
But they can't stop the music playing on.

Schooldays_EOT
 
If ever you think about the happiest days of your life
Cast back your mind for a while
And remember the time when you were a child.
Don't think of things that make you sad,
Just remember all the good times that you had.

Do you remember only happy days,
Full of flaming Junes and summer holidays?
Or do you remember those stormy Novembers
As we walked in the wind and the rain?
Schooldays were such happy days
Now they seem so far away,
I remember and I'll always treasure.
Schooldays were the happiest days of your life
But we never appreciate the good times we have
Until it's too late.

I miss all the acquaintances we made
And I'd go back if I could only find a way,
Schooldays were the happiest days
Though at the time they filled me with dismay.
We only remember what we choose to remember.
When I was a schoolboy I loathed regulations and rules
I hated my textbooks and my school uniform,
'Cos it made me conform,
And teachers were always disobeyed,
But I'd go back if I could only find a way.

Schooldays were the happiest days,
Now they seem so far away.
I remember and I'll always treasure
Schooldays were the happiest days of your life
But we never appreciate the good times we have
Until it's too late.
Now I wish I hadn't strayed,
And I'd go back if I could only find a way.
Those schooldays.

Jack The Idiot Dunce_EOT
 
Who's the fool with the cross-eyed stare,
The turned up nose and moronic glare?
Who's that simpleton standing over there?
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.

Who's that dumb-looking freckle-faced runt?
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.
He walks like his feet are on back to front,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.

When he waddles down the street he looks kind of queer,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce,
'Cos he's got two left feet and taxi-door ears,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.

And when we laugh at the clothes he wears,
Jack just smiles 'cos he don't care.
He's a fool!  He's a ninny!
He's a twit!  He's a chump!
The Idiot Dunce, the Idiot Dunce.

Who is always the bottom of the class?
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.
Who's a fool?  Who's a boob?
Who's a kook and an ass?
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.

When we take examinations he never gets a pass,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.
And we all put him down 'cos he can't think fast,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.
We ridicule him and punch him around,
But Jack just laughs and stands his ground,
The Idiot Dunce, the Idiot Dunce.

Yeah, he's so uncoordinated.
Whoa, and so disorientated,
And when we have a High School Hop
You ought to see that idiot bop
And his arms and his legs
Seem to have minds of their own,
And you don't need brains
To have educated muscles and bones.

Yeah, you ought to see him dance
He moves like he's in a trance,
And when we have a High School Hop
You ought to see that idiot rock,
And he's finally proved
That you don't need a high I.Q.
To make your body move.
Now he's created a dance that everybody's trying to do.
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.

Do the Idiot Dunce.
All right put your finger on your nose,
Now cross those eyes.
Put your hands on your hips,
Now wriggle your backside.
Yes, we got you dancing
To the Idiot Jack
From your head to the tips of your toes.

Now the whole world's doing it and everybody knows,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.
He's a real cool cat and a real gone groove,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.

And the girls go crazy when he starts to move,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce
Now Jack's a success he's got nothing to prove,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.

Even though Jack is dim
His mother is so proud of him.
Hey, who's that groovy looking dude
Dancing with all the chicks?
The Idiot Dunce, the Idiot Dunce.

Education_EOT
 
In a deep dark jungle, long time ago
Lived a lonesome caveman
He was a solitary soul
And he spent his playtime
Chewing meat from bones.
He didn't know how to talk much
He only knew how to groan
Then he lifted up his hands and reached to the sky
Let out a yell and no one replied.
Frustration and torment tore him inside
Then he fell to the ground and he cried and he cried.
But then education saved the day.
He learned to speak and communicate
Education saved the day.
He thanked God for the friends he made.
'Cos everybody needs an education
Everybody needs an education.
Black skin, red skin, yellow or white,
Everybody needs to read and write
Everybody needs an education.

Thank the day when that primitive man
Learned to talk with his brothers
And live off the land.
He left his cave and he moved far away
And he lived with his friends in a house that they'd made
He learned to think and to work with his brain
And he astounded his friends with all the knowledge he gained

He wrote it down on a rock that he found
And he showed all his friends and they passed it around
And then education came that day.
The day it came was a sacred day.
Education came that day
He thanked God for the friends he'd made.

Well man built a boat and he learned how to sail
And he traveled far and wide
Then he looked up above saw the stars in the sky
So he learned how to fly.
And the inventors with their high I.Q.s
And the professors in their colleges
Trying to feed me knowledge
That I know I'll never use.
Thank you sir for the millions of words
That you've handed me down and you've told me to learn

But I've got words in my ears and my eyes
I've got so many facts that I must memorize
Because education's doing me in
I want to stop but my head's in a swim
Education drives me insane
I can't recall all the facts on my brain.
Education came that day
The day it came was a sacred day
Education saved the day
He thanked God for all the friends he made.

Teacher, teach me how to read and write,
You can teach me about biology,
But you can't tell me what I am living for
'Cos that's still a mystery.
Teacher, teach me about nuclear physics
And teach me about the structure of man,
But all your endless calculations
Can't tell me why I am.
No you can't tell me why I am,
No you can't tell me why I am.

Everybody needs education,
Open Universities, education.
Every race, every creed, education.
And every little half-breed.
Every nationality, education.
All the little people need education.
Eskimos and pygmies need
And even aborigines, education.

Well, physics and geography, education.
Philosophy and history, education.
Science and biology, education,
Geometry and poetry, education.
Well, education, education, education, education

[Repeat 'education' till end]

The First Time We Fall In Love_EOT
 
How well I remember my very first love affair.
Those juvenile fantasies and innocent dreams we shared.
But we're too blind to realize that we are totally unprepared
For the first time we fall in love.
We think it's forever, the first time we fall in love.
We always treasure the first time we fall in love.
Those other romances come and go,
But we cherish the memory of
The first time we fall in love.

First love can be such a strain.
It can rule your head, it can bring you pain,
And when it ends it seems such a shame.
The first time we fall in love,
Can make you sad, it can keep you awake,
It can drive you mad.
People say you're too young and it's only a fad
The first time we fall in love.
The first time we fall in love.

The first time I fell out of love, it knocked me through the floor.
My world came crashing down, it shook me to the core.
I was unprepared 'cos I was only a kid
And I was much too young and I wasn't equipped
For the emotional pressures and stresses of it.
But oh, I'll never forget
The way that she looked the first time we met.
Time goes by but we never forget
The first time we fall in love.

Love can be exciting, it can be a bloody bore.
Love can be a pleasure or nothing but a chore.
Love can be like a dull routine,
It can run you around until you're out of steam.
It can treat you well, it can treat you mean,
Love can mess you around,
Love can pick you up, it can bring you down.
But they'll never know
The feelings we show
The first time we fall in love.
The first time we fall in love.

I'm In Disgrace_EOT
 
The first time that I saw you
You were the lady of my dreams.
The very next time I had to make you mine,
And I treated you like a queen.
The third time that I saw you
You treated me with such distaste,
Now I wish I'd never seen your face.
I'm in disgrace,
I'm in disgrace.
Because I fell for your pretty face,
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
You captured me in your embrace.

There's no use blaming me
And saying I was your ruination
'Cos it was you equally
That got us into this situation.
It wasn't lust, it wasn't rape,
It was just a mistake
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
Because I fell for your pretty face.
I'm in disgrace.  She's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
You captured me in your embrace.

Was your love real or faked?
Or was it only infatuation?
Picture you in my place.
I wish I'd acted with a little less haste.
I'm in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.
Because I fell for your pretty face.
Oh what a waste.  He's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
Now my name's dirt and I'm disgraced.
I'm in disgrace.

Headmaster_EOT
 
Headmaster, this is my confession.
This time you won't be overjoyed,
I have destroyed what little faith you had in me,
I've been such a naughty boy.
Headmaster I am at your mercy,
I've been such a little fool.
I've dishonored one who trusted me,
I have broken all the rules.
I've been with those naughty little girls again,
Now those naughty little girls are going to put me to shame.

I wish that I'd been born with a little more sense,
This time it's a serious offense.
I feel like an innocent victim,
I feel that I just can't win.
Headmaster please give me one chance,
Please help me to act like a man.
I've let down the school,
I've broken all the rules,
I've let down the side,
I've committed a crime.

Headmaster, this is my confession,
I've been such a little fool.
I've dishonored one who trusted me,
I have broken all the rules.
I've been such a little fool.
Don't tell all my friends I bent over,
Don't tell them you made me cry.
Don't tell them I've been sacrificed,
Don't tell all my friends or I'll die.
Headmaster don't beat me I beg you,
I know that I've let you down.
Headmaster please spare me I beg you,
Don't make me take my trousers down.

The Hard Way_EOT
 
Boys like you were born to waste,
You never listen to a word I say
And if you think you're here to mess around,
You're making a big mistake,
'Cos you're gonna find out the hard way,
You gonna find out the hard way.

No matter what I do or say,
You're much too dumb to educate.
One day life's going to turn around and slap you in the face,
Then you're gonna find out the hard way.
You'll take the hard way,
Gonna take the hard way.

Well, you'll do it your way and I'll do it my way,
And we'll see who's the one to survive.
You'll find that with no foundation
Or qualifications
There's no way that you can get by,
No, there's no way you can get by.

Why don't you take the easy way?
Why don't you co-operate?
Don't just sit there and vegetate.
Do you want to end up illiterate?
You think that life's a vacation
And you've no inclination
To dust away the cobwebs of your mind.
Now it's time for confrontation
And I'm tired of being patient,
So I've got to be cruel to be kind.
Yeah, I've got to be cruel to be kind.

I'm wasting my vocation teaching you to write neat
When you're only fit to sweep the streets.
Your intellect is such
That it requires a killer's touch.

So I'm going to play it your way,
We'll take the hard way.
Going to take the hard way,
You can take the hard way.
Gonna take the hard way,
Gonna take the hard way.

The Last Assembly_EOT
 
As I walked to the last assembly,
There were tears in the back of my eyes,
And I saw all my friends all around me,
They were there to wish me goodbye.

As I stood in a line with my comrades,
I felt such a feeling of pride,
And I forgot all the grief and the hatred inside,
As we sang for the very last time.

Gather round, gather round,
Everybody gather round.
Come and join our last assembly,
Let us smile, wipe away all the frowns.

Gather round, gather round,
Everybody gather round.
As we stood at the last assembly,
All my friends came to wish me goodbye.

Gather round, gather round,
Gather round, gather round,
Everybody gather round.
As I stand at the last assembly,
I just can't keep the tears from my eyes.

No More Looking Back_EOT
 
Walking along a crowded street
I see thousands of faces before me.
Then I see a face that I used to know
Long ago in my life story.
It starts me thinking about the things you said
For your image is still inside me.
The past is gone but in my head
You're still walking along beside me.
Is it something playing tricks with my eyes
Or just an illusion deceiving me,
Or is it someone in a disguise
Or visions of things that used to be?

But lately I've been going to
All the places that we once knew,
And just when I think that I am free of you
I keep seeing the things that remind me of you,
And just when I think you're out of my head
I hear a song that you sang or see a book that you read.
Then you're in every bar, you're in every cafe,
You're driving every car, I see you everyday,
But you're not really there 'cos you belong to yesterday.

No more looking back,
No more living in the past,
Yesterday's gone and that's a fact,
Now there's no more looking back.
Got to be hard,
Yeah, look straight ahead.
That s the only way it's going to be,
Yesterday's gone and that's a fact,
Now there's no more looking back,

Perhaps someday I'll stop needing you,
Then maybe one day I'll be free of you.
But lately I've been going to
All the places that remind me of you.
And just when I think you're out of my head
I hear a record you played or see a book that you read.
Then you're in every bar, you're in every cafe,
You're driving every car, I see you everyday
But you're not really there 'cos you belong to yesterday.

No more looking back,
No more living in the past.
Yesterday's gone, that's a fact,
Now there's no more looking back.
No more looking back.
No more living in the past.
Yesterday's gone, that's a fact.
Now there's no more looking back.

Life On The Road_EOT
 
Ever since I was a child,
I loved to wander wild
Through the bright city lights,
And find myself a life I could call my own.
It was always my ambition
To see Piccadilly,
Ramble and roam around Soho
And Pimlico and Savile Row,
And walk down the Abbey Road.
So I saved all my money
And packed up my clothes,
And I said good-bye to my friends
And my folks back home.
And I left for a life of my own.
I left for a life on the road.

I'm a real hungry tyke,
And I know what I like.
And I know where I'm goin':
To those bright city lights.
Oh yeah, oh yeah,
This time I'm gonna get there.
I'm bound for a life on the road.
Give me life on the road.
I said life on the road.

When I arrived in Euston,
I was little more than a child.
And I didn't know then
That the dives and the dens
Would be so vulgar and wicked and wild.
Mama always told me
The city ladies were bawdy and bold.
And so I searched night and day
To catch a kissable lady,
But all that I caught was a cold,
'Cause those stuck-up city ladies
Didn't notice me walk by.
Now I've got holes in my shoes
'Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night.
And I'm livin' the life that I chose.
Livin' my life on the road.
I said life on the road.
I want life on the road.
Life on the road.

I was standing with the punks in Praed Street,
When a muscle man came my way.
He said, "Hey, are you gay?
Can you come out and play?"
And like a fool, I went and said, "O.K."
Ever since I was knee high,
I thought the city was paved with gold.
But I've seen so many losers
And down and out boozers
Who were tired of bein' bought and sold.
City women are a tease,
But I'd really love to please.
Now I've got blood shot eyes
'Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night.
And it sure knocks you out on the road.
And I'm livin' my life on the road.
I said life on the road.
Life on the road.
I want life on the road.

One of these days,
I wanna go home,
Visit my friends,
And see all the places that I used to know,
And say good-bye to a world that's too real;
Good-bye to a world that's forgotten how to feel.
And it's slowly usin' me,
And there's no security.
Sometimes I hate the road,
But it's the only life I know.
But I'm livin' the life that I chose,
So I'll live out my life on the road.

Give me life on the road.
I said life on the road.
[Repeat]

Mr. Big Man_EOT
 
I remember when you started out,
You were the best friend I ever knew.
I tried to meet you when you had your success,
But you had better things to do.
Now I bet that you're losin' count
Of the people that you used.
But now we're gonna see the vicious side of you,

Mister Big.
You've got the say and the power.
Your minions grovel and cower.
But I see you, and I see me.
But you're the big man now.
You got it, Mister Big.
Your followers kiss your hand,
And your slaves all at your feet.
Your minions serve your beck and call,
But they don't compensate at all,
'Cause inside, Mister Big's very small.

When you were poor and knockin' at the door,
You were really lots of fun.
But now you're hot and you're sittin' on the top;
You've got no time for anyone.
You schemed and connived.
You pushed and you lied,
Till you at last became a star.
But now we're gonna see the way you really are,

Mister Big.
Now your vict'ry is complete
And your battles are all won.
Your enemies and foes are all stacked up in rows,
Eliminated one by one.
You got it, Mister Big.

Sleepwalker_EOT
 
Ev'rybody got problems, buddy.  I got mine.
When midnight comes around, I start to lose my mind.
When the sun puts out the light,
I join the creatures of the night,
Oh yeah.

I'm a sleepwalker.
I'm a night stalker.
I'm a street walker.
I'm a night hawker.

Ev'rybody got secrets that they wanna hide.
When midnight comes along, I take a look inside.
Don't go talkin' in your sleep:
I might come in for a peep,
Oh yeah.'

I'm a sleepwalker.
I'm a night stalker.

When ev'rybody's fast asleep, I start to creep.
Through the shadows of the moonlight, I walk my beat.
Better close your window tight:
I might come in for a bite,
Oh yeah.

When the night time comes, I start to creep.
I prowl around when you're fast asleep.
I walk around on my tippy toes,
And I get into places that nobody knows.

I'm always around if you wanna meet.
You can find me on almost ev'ry street.
You'll always get me on the telephone.
I'll even come to your home if you're ever alone.

I'm a sleepwalker.
I'm a night stalker.
I'm a street walker.
I'm a night hawker.

Brother_EOT
 
The world's goin' crazy and
Nobody gives a damn anymore.
And they're breakin' off relationships and
Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores.
For them it's all over,
But I'm gonna stay.
I wouldn't leave anyway.
I know that someday we'll find a way.
We'll be O.K.

'Cause I'm your brother,
Though I don't even know your name.
I've discovered that,
Deep down inside, you feel the same.
Our friends are leavin'.
Now they seem so far away.
But we shouldn't feel afraid.
There's so much that we can say.
You're my brother,
Though I didn't know you yesterday.
I'm your brother.
Together we can find a way.

The world's goin' crazy and
Nobody gives a damn anymore.
And they're breakin' off relationships and
Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores.
The old world's fadin'.
Now it seems so far away.
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.
There's so much that we can share.
I'm your brother.

The world's goin' crazy and
Nobody gives a damn anymore.
And they're breakin' off relationships and
Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores.
You're my brother,
Though I didn't know you yesterday.
I'm your brother.
Together we can find a way.

Juke Box Music_EOT
 
There's a lady plays her fav'rite records
On the jukebox ev'ry day.
All day long she plays the same old songs,
And she believes the things that they say.

Other ladies like to prance around
And flirt and dance the whole night through,
But she just sits and listens to her juke box records,
'Cause that's all that she wants to do.

She sings along with all the saddest songs,
And she believes the stories are real.
She let's the music dictate the way that she feels.

It's only juke box music,
Only juke box music.
It's only music,
Only juke box music,
Only juke box music.

Seems to me she's in a fantasy.
She's livin' in a world of her own.
And we all agree that she's a mystery,
Because she'd rather be all alone.

Ev'ry guy will do his best to try
To put that music out of her head.
Forget all the songs,
And just dance to the music instead.

It's only juke box music,
Only juke box music.
It's only music,
Only juke box music,
Only juke box music.

It's all because of that music
That we're slowly driftin' apart.
But it's only there to dance to,
So you shouldn't take it to heart.

Music, only juke box music.
Only music, only juke box music.
[Repeat]

Sleepless Night_EOT
 
Oh, there's a rude little lady
Livin' next to me.
Oh, she sure loves someone,
But it ain't me.
Ev'ry night at twelve o'clock,
They start to rock with all they got.
They keep it up all night.
It just ain't right.

They O.K. by me, I'm not.
He and she, they all right.
Once they start, they never stop
Through this sleepless night.
Once I was her lover.
It was so good to be.
Now she's got somebody else and I can't sleep.
Ooh, nothin' hurts people more than other people do.
But what can you do?

Meanwhile, upstairs, they O.K.
Ev'rythin' is all right.
I wish that I could find a way
Through this sleepless night.
Ooh, this sleepless night.
Ooh, this sleepless night.

Ooh, that wicked lady,
She's got a hold on me.
Ooh, she doesn't want me,
But she won't let me be.
They play that music ev'ry night.
It rocks my bed; it shakes my light.
They ball with all their might.
It just ain't right.

Ooh, this sleepless night.
Ooh, this sleepless night.

Stormy Sky_EOT
 
Oh, oh darlin',
Little darlin',
Did you ever see such a stormy sky?
It's never been like this before.

All the people,
They're runnin'.
Ev'rybody's try'n' to hide,
To get away from that stormy sky.
Perhaps it's a sign
Of what we're headed for.

We're under a stormy sky,
Watchin' the clouds roll by.
But won't you let me keep you warm,
And leave the storm outside?
It's only a stormy sky.

I feel it.
Do you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feels like we're in for a stormy night,
But I can't see a cloud in sight.

I see it.
Do you see it?
Can't you see it,
See that warning in that stormy sky.
But perhaps its gonna pass us by,
So don't you cry.
There's nowhere we can hide.

But if you hold me tight,
I know that we'll be all right.
Tomorrow we'll laugh about it;
Greet the mornin' light.
It's only a stormy sky.

We're under a stormy sky,
Watchin' the clouds roll by.
But there'll be another dawn
To clear the storm away,
And we will be all right.

Full Moon_EOT
 
Haven't you noticed a kind of madness in my eyes?
It's only me, dear, in my midnight disguise.
Pay no attention if I crawl across the room.
It's just another full moon.

Don't be afraid of me when I'm walking in my sleep.
Don't get alarmed, dear, when I start to crawl and creep.
Try not to listen when I mumble like a loon.
It's just another full moon.
It's just another full moon.

You see before you a truly broken man.
'Cause when it gets to midnight, I don't know who I am.
Full moon's a-callin', and it's put a curse on me,
And it will never set me free.

The full moon's still up there,
Like a great white balloon.
The owls are a-callin',
And they're singin' my tune.
The night keeps a-callin'.
I wish the day would come soon,
To get away from another full moon.
Here comes another full moon.

If your hands start shakin'
When night starts to fall,
If you're scared of the moonlight
And the shadows on the wall,
If the face in the mirror
Isn't you at all,
It's just another full moon.
It's just another full moon.

La la la la la la.
La la la la la la.
La la la la la la.
La la la la la la.
It's just another full moon.

Life Goes On_EOT
 
A friend of mine just had a real bad time.
You see, his life was shattered and he lost his mind.
His girl ran off along with his best friend,
And through emotional stress he brought his life to an end.
It was such a tragedy,
But that's the way it's got to be.
Life goes on.

Life goes on.
It happens ev'ry day.
So appreciate what you got
Before it's taken away.
Life will hit you
When you're unprepared,
So be grateful and take all
That you can while you're there.
Get that frown off your head,
'Cause you're a long time dead.
Life goes on and on and on.
Life goes on and on and on.

No use runnin' 'round lookin' scared,
Life could get you when you're unaware.
One day it's gonna come, so you better accept it.
Life will hit you when you least expect it.
And one day when you are gone,
You know that life will still go on.
But no one'll care if you've been good, bad, right or wrong.
Life will still go on.

My bank went broke and my well ran dry.
It was almost enough to contemplate suicide.
I turned on the gas, but I soon realized
I hadn't settled my bill so they cut off my supply.
No matter how I try, it seems I'm too young to die.
Life goes on and on and on.
Life goes on and on and on.

Tornado, cyclone and hurricane
Can batter the houses with the thunder and rain.
Blizzards can blow; the waves hit the shore,
But the people recover and come back for more.
Somehow the people fight back, even the future looks black.
Life goes on and on and on.
Life goes on and on and on.

Artificial Light_EOT
 
Slow dancing in a disco,
Standing underneath the light show,
Illuminated by the artificial light.

I disbelieved it at first sight,
I couldn't tell if she was black or white,
It didn't matter in the artificial light,
Artificial light.
Artificial light.
Artificial light.
Artificial light.

First time I saw her she was easy to know,
She had nothing to hide, she put it all out to show.
She didn't cover up or try to conceal,
I knew the way that she felt 'cause her expression was real.
She didn't cover up the inside,
She showed it all on the outside,
Stark naked in the artificial light.

Everybody gotta learn to relax,
To be yourself you have to put on an act.
Get together in the artificial light.

And if I saw her in the light of day,
I wouldn't know what to say, I wouldn't know what had happened.
I only wanna know a world below,
Where we can be ourselves beneath an artificial glow.

And if you're scared what your friend'll say,
And you're embarrassed by the light of day,
Get together in the artificial light.

Everybody let yourself go,
Everybody to a floor show,
Get together in the artificial light.
Artificial light,
Artificial light,
Artificial light,
Artificial light.

Prince Of The Punks_EOT
 
A well known groover, rock 'n' roll user,
Wanted to be a star.
But he failed the blues, and he's back to loser,
Playing folk in a country bar.

Reggae music didn't seem to satisfy his needs.
He couldn't handle modern jazz,
'Cause they play it in difficult keys.
But now he's found a music he can call his own,
Some people call it junk, but he don't care,
He's found a home.

He's the prince of the punks and he's finally made it,
Thinks he looks cool but his act is dated.
He acts working class but it's all bologna,
He's really middle class and he's just a phony.
He acts tough but it's just a front,
He's the prince of the punks.

He's the prince of the punks and he's finally made it,
Thinks he looks cool but his act is dated.

He tried to be gay, but it didn't pay,
So he bought a motorbike instead.
He failed at funk, so he became a punk,
'Cause he thought he'd make a little more bread.

He's been through all of the changes,
From rock opera to Mantovani.
Now he wears a swastika band
And leather boots up past his knees.

He's much too old for twenty-eight,
But he thinks he's seventeen,
He thinks he's a stud,
But I think he looks more like a queen.

He's the prince of the punks and he's finally made it,
Thinks he looks cool but his act is dated.
He talks like a Cockney but it's all bologna,
He's really middle class and he's just a phony.
He acts tough but it's just a front.

He's the prince of the punks and he's finally made it,
Thinks he looks cool but his act is dated.
He acts working class but it's all bologna,
He's really middle class and he's just a phony.
He acts tough but it's just a front,

He's the prince of the punks and he's finally made it,
Thinks he looks cool but his act is dated.
He acts working class but it's all bologna,
He's really middle class and he's just a phony.

He's the prince of the punks.

The Poseur_EOT
 
The Poseur's in town
The Poseur's around

Hey, it don't bother me,
But there's a guy eyein' you
He's watched you all night and he's looked you all over
He got his eye on you
But don't act like you're surprised
Because that smooth-looking guy's undressing you with his eyes

Look at him look you over
He thinks he can win you over
He'll flirt for a while, make passes and smile at you
But he'll never come over
'Cause he's just a poseur
Who thinks he's a Cassonova

That dude standing over there
He thinks he really looks cool
The ladies think he looks smooth
But he's rehearsed every move
He stands in front of the mirror all day
Now he's on display and he's so well routined
We've all come here to dance but he's just here to be seen

Look at him bossa nova
Look at him move and sway
But he's been practicing days to make his hair fall a certain way
But he'll never come over
'Cause he's just a poseur
Who thinks he's a Casanova

Look at him bossa nova, yeah
The Poseur's in town

Yeah

On The Outside_EOT
 
You stay at home,
All on your own with nothing but walls to talk to.
You never go anywhere,
You say you've nothing to wear,
So you keep all your troubles inside of you.
There's something hidden in you,
And you keep it out of view.
You shouldn't feel any guilt,
Or have any doubts,
You gotta let yourself out whilst there's something left of you

Hey baby blue,
Don't hide your troubles inside.
I'd sure like to knoe you,
And there's so much to show you on the outside.
Somehow I know that we are goona get by,
So stop acting like a ladfy come and cry like a baby on the outside
Outside
I know that the weather is fine,
Outside
I know we're gonna be alright.
Somehow I know that we are goonna survive.
So stop acting like a lady come and cry like a baby on the outside
On the outside

You think you're a freak,
And you're afraid to compete,
In a world that you thinks got it down on you,
You're a closet queen,
You think it's obscene,
To let the people see what's deep inside of you.
I know what you're going through,
But what you are is nothing new,
So don't feel ashamed
'Cos you're not to blame,
Role up the blinds and let the sun come shining through.

Hey baby blue
Don't hide your troubles inside,
You should be glad in the gay,
Nobody cares anyway on the outside.
Somehow I know that we are gonna get by,
So stop acting like a lady come and cry like a baby on the outside.
Outside
I know that the weather is fine
Outside
I know it's gonna be alright.
Somehow I know that we are gonna get by,
So stop acting like a lady come and cry like baby on the outside.
On the outside
On the outside

Misfits_EOT
 
You've been sleeping in a field but you look real rested
You set out to outrage but you can't get arrested
You say your image is new, but it looks well tested
You're lost without a crowd yet you go your own way

You say your summer has gone
Now the winter is crawlin' in
They say that even in your day
Somehow you never could quite fit in
Though it's cold outside
I know the summer's gonna come again
Because you know what they say
Every dog has his day

You're a misfit, afraid of yourself so you run away and hide
You've been a misfit all your life
Why don't you join the crowd
And come inside
You wander round this town like you've lost your way
You had your chance in your day
Yet you threw it all away
But you know what they say
Every dog has his day

Look at all the losers and the mad eyed gazers
Look at all the loonies and the sad eyed failures
They've given up living 'cos they just don't care
So take a good look around
The misfits are everywhere
La la la la la la

This is your chance, this is your time
So don't throw it away
You can have your day
'Cause it's true what they say
Every dog has his day

You're a misfit
Afraid of yourself so you run away and hide
You've been a misfit all your life
But why don't you join the crowd and come inside
You wander round this town
Like you've lost your way
You had your chance in your day
Yet you threw it all away
Now you're lost in the crowd
Yet, still go your own way

Hay Fever_EOT
 
Sitting by my stereo all alone
My baby calls me on the telephone
She says, Baby take me out for a dance
I tell my baby I feel so bad
I can't go out and it's making me sad
But when you see me, I know you will understand

I got hay fever, blocking up my head
Hay fever, I ought to be in bed
How can I dance when I can hardly breathe
Wish I could cure this infernal allergy
I got hay fever blocking up my brain
Hay fever, feel the sinus pains
And all the pills and the powders are in vain
Thought I was cured but here it comes again
It goes ooh-ah

The pollen count's getting higher and higher
My eyes are sore and my nose is on fire
My throat's dry now and I'm starting to perspire
My stuffed up head's killing all of my desire
I got hay fever, you wicked allergy
Hay fever, you put the curse on me
And I've inhaled every know remedy

I can't stay cool 'cos I'm starting to sneeze
I can't make love when I can't hardly breathe
We start to dance and my nose starts to bleed
There must be a cure for this hay fever
Is there a pill or a powder I can take
I must get a cure, my romance is at stake

Hay fever, you tore my image down
Hay fever, I must look like a clown
I must have used every tissue in town
I'm running round sniffin' like a hound
I go ooh-ah

I wanna kiss but I'm sneezin' instead
I can't make love when my head feels like lead
How can I pose when my nose is all red
We should be home, should be tucked up in bed
But I got hay fever
Hay Fever

Hay Fever
Hay Fever
Hay Fever

Live Life_EOT
 
Have you heard about trouble throughout the land
With the fascists and the left wing militants
Out of work executives are killing themselves
And the I.R.A. are killing everybody else
Don't panic, don't lose control
Keep your head, keep a hold
Act normal, there's nothing wrong
Stay cool, just carry on

You gotta live life and be yourself
You can't live life for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Don't get depressed when you read in the press
About world revolution and social unrest
Try not to panic when you switch on the news
And see the crooked politicians and the unemployment queues
It's only life, it's really fine
So don't you believe all you read in the headlines
Live life, see it through
Carry on, it's all you can do

You gotta live life for yourself
You can't live for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Trendy intellectuals always take action,
For every cause that's ever been in fashion
Weekend revolutionaries protest and sing
Because they're dedicated followers of any old thing
They got every solution for every revolution
They live in the slums just like the poor people do
But they'd rather sniff coke instead of glue
Right-wing fascists beat up the blacks
Then they salute the Union Jack
You can't pretend there's nothing wrong
It's not the end, so just carry on

You gotta live life for yourself
You can't live for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother
Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother

You gotta live life for yourself
Can't live life for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you can do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Live life, you gotta live life
You gotta live life, you gotta live life

A Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy_EOT
 
Hello you, hello me, hello people we used to be
Isn't it strange, we never changed
We've been through it all yet we're still the same
And I know it's a miracle we still go, and for all we know
We might still have a way to go

Hello me, hello you, you say you want out
Want to start anew, throw in your hand
Break up the band, start a new life, be a new man
But for all we know, we might still have a way to go
Before you go, there's something you ought to know

There's a guy in my block, he lives for rock
He plays records day and night
And when he feels down he puts some rock 'n' roll on
And it makes him feel alright
And when he feels the world is closing in
He turns his stereo way up high

He just spends his life living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life living on the edge of reality
He just spends his life in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life living on the edge of reality
He just spends his life in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy

Look at me, look at you
You say we've got nothing left to prove
The King is dead, rock is done
You might be through but I've just begun
I don't know, I feel free and I won't let go
Before you go, there's something you ought to know

Dan is a fan and he lives for our music
It's the only thing that gets him by
He's watched us grow and he's seen all our shows
He's seen us low and he's seen us high
Oh, but you and me keep thinking
That the world's just passing us by

Don't want to spend my life living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
Don't want to spend my life living on the edge of reality
Don't want to waste my life hiding away anymore
Don't want to spend my life living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy

In A Foreign Land_EOT
 
It was a matter of fact that when I paid all my tax
I held my world in the palm of my hand
And all of my debts were causing me to defect
To a land of bananas and sand
So I ran, yes I ran, yes I ran to a foreign land
Here I am, here I am
Here I am in a foreign land

I'm so glad we made it
I thought we'd never land
I grabbed all my cash
And I decided to dash far away
Far away, far away in a foreign land
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land

Goodbye to all of the rich men's daughters
Goodbye to my debts now I'm way across the water
Far away, far away in a foreign land
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Please tell my mother and all my ex-lovers
That I've finally made the grade

Please tell my debtors and the money collectors
That all of my bills will be paid some day
I'm away, I'm away in a foreign land

Goodbye champagne and the caviar set
I wanna slum and drink all of the rum I can get
I'm away, I'm away in a foreign land
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land
But I'm all out of my jack and I can't go back
I'm away, far away, far away in a foreign land

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Permanent Waves_EOT
 
Please call a doctor, I've been so depressed
That I think that I'm finally breakin'
I can't quite explain, I can't feel any pain
But I know that this time I'm not fakin'
Oh, what can it be, oh, inside of me

I saw my doctor he said man you look sick
He said I think you better do something quick
He checked me over and he said I was fit
What you need is a change, have a shave, find a chick
Your body functions but your hair's a disgrace
You shouldn't let it hang all over your face
Change your image 'cos you look out of place
Comb your hair, put on weight, try to look up to date
Why don't you put in some permanent waves
You'll look smooth, you'll look cool, you'll be laughing
You'll get lots of dates, you'll be made, you'll get laid
You'll get out and about, you'll be laughing
Oh, you'll be O.K. once you get those permanent waves

I was really up but now I'm down once again
I went out walking and it started to rain
My perm washed out it just got flushed down the drain
My neurosis returned, I'm a wreck once again
But wait 'til I get back my permanent waves
I'll be cool, I'll be smooth, I'll be laughing
I'll be all the rage in my permanent waves
And I'll start a new craze, I'll be laughing
Oh, I'll be O.K. once I get my permanent waves

Black Messiah_EOT
 
Everybody got the right to speak their mind
So don't shoot me for saying mine
Everybody talking about racial equality
'Cos everybody's equal in the good Lord's eyes
But if I told you that God was black
What would you think of that
I bet you wouldn't believe it

There's a self made prophet living right next to me
He said the Black Messiah's gonna come and set the whole world free
He looked at me with his evil eye and prophesied
And he really believed it

He said a Black Messiah is gonna set the world on fire
And he no liar, 'cos he has truly heard the word
Everybody talk about racial equality
But I'm the only honky living on an all black street
They knock me down 'cos they brown and I white
Like you wouldn't believe it

They say a Black Messiah is gonna set the world on fire
A Black Messiah is gonna come and rule the world
Everybody talk about racial equality
Everybody talk about equal rights
But white's white, black's black and that's that
Everybody got the right to speak their mind
So don't shoot me for saying mine

Everybody talking about racial equality
You hear everybody talking about equal rights
But white's white, black's black and that's that
And that's the way you should leave it

Don't want no Black Messiah to come and set the world on fire
A Black Messiah is gonna come and rule the world
Everybody got to show a little give and take
Everybody got to live with a little less hate
Everybody gotta work it out, we gotta sort it out
Everybody got the right to speak their mind
So don't shoot me for saying mine

Out Of The Wardrobe_EOT
 
Has anybody here seen a chick called Dick
He looks real burly but he's really hip
He's six feet tall and his arms are all brown and hairy

He married Betty Lou back in '65 when you had to be butch to survive
But lately he's been looking at his wife with mixed emotions
You see, he's not a common place closet queen
He shouldn't be hidden, he should be seen
'Cos when he puts on that dress he looks like a princess

Well, the day he came out of the wardrobe
Betty Lou got quite a surprise
She didn't know whether she should get angry or not bat an eye
She really couldn't call up her mama
Mama would positively die
Should she go or stay, or should she try to get a trial separation

You see, he's not a faggot as you might suppose
He just feels restricted in conventional clothes
'Cos when he puts on that dress he feels like a princess

He's not a dandy, he's only living out a fantasy
He's not a pansy, he's only being what he wants to be
Now his life is rearranged and he's grateful for the change
He's out of the wardrobe and now he's got no regrets

Betty Lou didn't know what to do at first
But she's learning to cope at last
She got the best of both worlds
And she's really in a state of elation
She says it helped their relationship
She says a change is as good as a rest
And their friends are finally coming 'round to their way of thinking
She wears the trousers and smokes a pipe
And he washes up
She helps him wipe
'Cos when he puts on that dress he looks like a princess

He's out of the wardrobe and he's feeling alright
He's out of the wardrobe and he's feeling satisfied
Now it's farewell to the past
The secret's out at last
He's out of the wardrobe and now he's got no regrets

Trust Your Heart_EOT
 
In a sheltered place where I viewed the world
And all that it contained
I would see your face in a misty haze
And wish that you were there
Yes I wished that you were there
Darling Fool, I was with you all the way
Be as the flower that unfolds with each day

Trust your place in time though you have won and lost
How very much like me you are
When you come to me
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, oh truly trust your heart

Why bear malice just let it go
So what of pride it will swallow you whole
Here's to the judge, to the tyrant, and the beast
You keep a knockin' but you can't come in
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, truly trust your heart

The moonlight of your soul, told of memories long ago
Of the days when we were young
Of love that we'd forever hold
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, truly trust your heart
I bring thunder, lightning and rain
For those who administer injustice and pain
Comfort the weak and feed the poor
What on earth do we need government for?
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, oh truly trust your heart

Get Up_EOT
 
Here's a song for all the little men who get forgotten time and time again
Here's a message for the little guy, don't let this situation pass you by
You're in the middle while the big mouths fight
You get it from the left and the right, ain't it crazy

So get up off your easy chairs, we've got a lot to do out there
Well ain't we?
Good's gone bad, right is wrong, don't know which side I'm on lately

Get up from the down you're in
Come out of your homes and let's see your faces
Get up out of your easy chairs, get up and show 'em that you're there
Get up it's your one salvation
Wise up to the situation

Somebody gotta get up and shout
Somebody gotta give us some clout
You're the ones to make it all work out
It all depends on you

Get up off your arses men
Don't let 'em think you're getting lazy
Get up out of your easy chairs
We gotta lot to do out there, well ain't we
Get up, Get up, Get up,
Get up, Get up, Get up

Father Christmas_EOT
 
When I was small I believed in Santa Claus
Though I knew it was my dad
And I would hang up my stocking at Christmas
Open my presents and I'd be glad

But the last time I played Father Christmas
I stood outside a department store
A gang of kids came over and mugged me
And knocked my reindeer to the floor

They said:
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys.
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Don't give my brother a Steve Austin outfit
Don't give my sister a cuddly toy
We don't want a jigsaw or monopoly money
We only want the real McCoy

Father Christmas, give us some money
We'll beat you up if you make us annoyed
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys

But give my daddy a job 'cause he needs one
He's got lots of mouths to feed
But if you've got one, I'll have a machine gun
So I can scare all the kids down the street

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Have yourself a merry merry Christmas
Have yourself a good time
But remember the kids who got nothin'
While you're drinkin' down your wine

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
Father Christmas, please hand it over
We'll beat you up, so don't make us annoyed

Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread, so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Attitude_EOT
 
You go down the pub
You wear make up
And old dads trousers
Why don't you tidy up
You talk like a docker but you act like a queer
You drink champagne then complain it's too dear
You try so hard not to follow any trends
Then you cry in your beer and say you've got no friends
But is it any wonder that you've got no friends
But it's not the make up
Or the way you dress
It's not your appearance, that they all detest
It's not your manners, that you gotta improve
Ooooo-it's your attitude.

[Chorus]
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude

Take off your head phones
Hear what's going on
You can't live in a time zone
You've gotta move on
But before you get there
There's one thing you've gotta do
Oh change your attitude
It's your attitude
It's your attitude

[Chorus]
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude

The '80s are here, I know cuz I'm staring right at them
But you're still waiting for 1960 to happen

You might have the illness, but you've got the cure
You've got the answer, you will endure
You're the only person that's gonna pull you through
Ooh, with your attitude

[Chorus]
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude

You gotta learn to be positive, it's your only chance
You mustn't be so defensive, you gotta join in the dance
But it isn't your dancing that you've gotta improve
Ooh, it's your attitude.

[Chorus]
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude

It's all the music
It's all in your brain
You've used all the old licks
Now it's all gotta change.
Change your attitude
It's your attitude
Attitude

Catch Me Now I'm Falling_EOT
 
I remember, when you were down
And you needed a helping hand
I came to feed you
But now that I need you
You won't give me a second glance
Now I'm calling all citizens from all over the world
This is Captain America calling
I bailed you out when you were down on your knees
So will you catch me now I'm falling

Help me now I'm calling you
Catch me now I'm falling
I'm in your hands, it's up to you
Catch me now I'm falling

I remember when you were down
You would always come running to me
I never denied you and I would guide you
Through all of your difficulties
Now I'm calling all citizens from all over the world
This is Captain America calling
I bailed you out when you were down on your knees
So will you catch me now I'm falling

Help me now I'm calling you
Catch me now I'm falling
I'm in your hands, it's up to you
Catch me now I'm falling

When you were broke you would come to me
And I would always pull you round
Now I call your office on the telephone
And your secretary tells me that she's sorry,
But, you've gone out of town.

This is Captain America calling
This is Captain America calling

Help me now I'm calling you
Catch me now I'm falling
I'm in your hands, it's up to you
Catch me now I'm falling

Catch me now I'm falling
Catch me now I'm falling
Catch me now I'm falling
Catch me now I'm falling

I stood by you through all of your depressions
And I lifted you when you were down
Now it's your chance to do the same for me
I call your office and your secretary tells me
That you've gone out of town

This is Captain America calling
This is Captain America calling

Catch me now I'm falling
Catch me now I'm falling

I was the one who always bailed you out
Of your depressions and your difficulties
I never thought that you would let me down
But the next time you're in trouble
Better not come running to me

Now I'm calling all citizens from all over the world
This is Captain America calling
I bailed you out when you were down on your knees
So will you catch me now I'm falling
Catch me now I'm falling

Catch me now I'm falling
Catch me now I'm falling
Catch me now I'm falling
Catch me now I'm falling

Pressure_EOT
 
Pressure pressure I got pressure, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Pressure pressure I got pressure, oh yeah

I don't really want to give it to you
'Cos it's really contagious
You can pick it up anywhere
And it can be quite dangerous
You can spread it mouth to mouth
You can even get it when you're alone
But I can always live with it
Whenever I am close to you

Pressure pressure I got pressure, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Pressure pressure I got pressure

I get it driving in my motor car
I get it when I'm drinking in a bar
I get it riding on the subway
I get it regular every day
And anyone who never had it yet
And doesn't know what I'm going through
But I forget the pressure
When I am close to you

Altogether now-Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Pressure pressure I got pressure Oh yeah. oh yeah. oh yeah
Pressure pressure FEEL THE PRESSURE

You got the pressure and that's a fact
I can tell by the way you act
And I can tell that you're pressurised
By the look that's in your eyes
I know the pressure 'cos I've got it too
So I know what you're going through
But I forget the pressure
Whenever I am close to you

National Health_EOT
 
Nervous tension, man's invention,
Is the biggest killer that's around today
Let the tension out or it will build and build inside
And strike you down some day
Nervous tension, man's invention
Is the biggest waste of human energy
Let the tension out, or it will surely kill
And that will be a tragedy

Valium helps you for a while
But somehow valium seems to bring me down
There's no pill I can recommend where side effects
Aren't guaranteed to send you round the bend

You gotta let out the tension
With a little bit of exercise
Loosen up your muscles
And feel the knots in your body untie

We oh we oh
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah

It sure beats quaaludes
It sure beats cocaine
Even Freud recommends it
Cos it relieves the strain

Altogether now
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah

Some people say it sends you deaf
Some people say it sends you blind
Some people say it makes you old
Some people say it blows your mind

But I say

If it's good for your health
It's good for your mind
If it keeps you together
It's really all right
We oh we oh

Oh c'mon, kick the cat

Oh oh oh oh it's the state of the national health
Oh oh oh oh Blame it on the national health

Nervous tension, nervous tension, nervous tension
Nervous tension. nervous tension, nervous tension
Nervous tension, man's invention
Is the biggest killer that's around

(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman_EOT
 
Woke up this morning, started to sneeze
I had a cigarette and a cup of tea
I looked in the mirror what did I see
A nine stone weakling with knobbly knees
I did my knees bend press ups touch my toes
I had another sneeze and I blew my nose
I looked in the mirror at my pigeon chest
I had to put on my clothes because it made me depressed
Surely there must be a way
For me to change the shape I'm in
Dissatisfied is what I am
I want to be a better man

Superman Superman wish I could fly like Superman
Superman Superman I want to be like Superman
I want to be like Superman
Superman Superman wish I could fly like Superman

Woke up this morning, what did I see
A big black cloud hanging over me
I switched on the radio and nearly dropped dead
The news was so bad that I fell out of bed
There was a gas strike, oil strike, lorry strike, bread strike
Got to be a Superman to survive
Gas bills, rent bills, tax bills, phone bills
I'm such a wreck but I'm staying alive

[Look in the paper, what do I see,
Robbery, violence, insanity.]

Hey girl we've got to get out of this place
There's got to be something better than this
I need you, but I hate to see you this way
If I were Superman then we'd fly away
I'd really like to change the world
And save it from the mess it's in
I'm too weak, I'm so thin
I'd like to fly but I can't even swim

Superman Superman I want to fly like Superman
Superman Superman wish I could fly like Superman
Superman Superman wish I could fly like Superman
Superman Superman I want to be like Superman
Superman Superman I want to fly like Superman

Low Budget_EOT
 
Cheap is small and not too steep
But best of all cheap is cheap
Circumstance has forced my hand
To be a cut price person in a low budget land
Times are hard but we'll all survive
I just got to learn to economize

I'm on a low budget
I'm on a low budget
I'm not cheap, you understand
I'm just a cut price person in a low budget land
Excuse my shoes they don't quite fit
They're a special offer and they hurt me a bit
Even my trousers are giving me pain
They were reduced in a sale so I shouldn't complain
They squeeze me so tight so I can't take no more
They're size 28 but I take 34

I'm on a low budget
What did you say
I'm on a low budget
I thought you said that

I'm on a low budget
I'm a cut price person in a low budget land

I'm shopping at Woolworth and low discount stores
I'm dropping my standards so that I can buy more

[Quality costs, but quality wastes,
So I'm giving up all of my expensive tastes.
Caviar and champagne are definite no's,
I'm acquiring a taste for brown ale and cod roes ]

Low budget sure keeps me on my toes
I count every penny and I watch where it goes
We're all on our uppers we're all going skint
I used to smoke cigars but now I suck polo mints

I'm on a low budget
What did you say
Yea I'm on a low budget
I thought you said that
I'm on a low budget
I'm a cut price person in a low budget land
I'm on a low budget
Low budget
Low budget

Art takes time, time is money
Money's scarce and that ain't funny
Millionaires are things of the past
We're in a low budget film where nothing can last
Money's rare there's none to be found
So don't think I'm tight if I don't buy a round

I'm on a low budget
What did you say
Yes I'm on a low budget
I thought you said that
I'm on a low budget
I'm a cut price person in a low budget land
I'm on a low budget
Say it again
Low budget
One more time
Low budget

[I look like a tramp, but don't write me off,
I'll have you all know, I was once a tough
At least my hair is all mine, my teeth are my own,
But everything else is on permanent loan.
Once all my clothes were made by hand,
Now I'm a cut price person in a low budget land.
I'm on a low budget
I'll have you all know
We're on a low budget
I'm on a low budget]

In A Space_EOT
 
In a space allocated to me by the human race
Inhabiting this area until I die this space is occupied
I'm in a space leased by kind permission of the human race
Close up I am big but far away I'm small and hardly here at all
'Cause in a space out in space
We disappear without a trace

Now I'm out in inner space
And lookin' at the people. standing face to face
And filling up the space
Men and women boys and girls
There are so many people in the world
Thinkin' about the world
And all the people in it
And I'm staring at the stars
And into the infinite
In a world within a world
On a planet that's
Driftin' in a space

Seconds into minutes and minutes
Into hours and hours into days
And days into months and months into years
And years into decade tens into thousands
Thousands into millions, millions into billions
Billions into zillions and forever and forever

In a space allocated by the human race
Somewhere in outer space it's far away and I like it that way
Now I'm out in inner space
And lookin' at the people, standing face to face
And filling up the space
Men and women boys and girls
There are so many people in the world
Thinkin' about the world
And all the people in it
And I'm staring at the stars
And into the infinite
In a world within a world
On a planet that's
Driftin' in a space

In a space, in a space, in a space
Now I'm out in inner space
And lookin' at the people standing face to face
And filling up the space
On a planet that's
Driftin' in a space

Little Bit Of Emotion_EOT
 
See all the people
With hatred in their eyes
I can't help thinking that
It's only a disguise
Cause underneath that core
There's got to be more
Than what we realize

Maybe they're scared
To let the inside out
Maybe they're afraid to
Show what they're all about
So they put on a heavy front and hope that no one else
Can work them out
So they put on all the heaviness
But its only an illusion heaviness
Can't you see
They're scared to
Show a little bit of emotion
A little bit of real emotion
In case a little bit of emotion
Gives them away

Look at that lady dancing around with no clothes
She'll give you all her body
That's if you've got the dough
She'll let you see most
Anything but there's one thing
That she'll never show
And that's a little bit of real emotion
A little bit of true emotion
In case a little bit of emotion
Gives her away
But it's a shame she's acting that way
Somehow she's gotta get through every day
And the only way
Is not to show one little bit of emotion
A little bit of true emotion
In case a little bit of emotion gives her away

People learn their lines
And they act out their part
Then they talk on cue
But it's got no heart
It's all on the surface
And it's all contrived
They're scared to come out
Somehow they've got to survive

Look at that looney
With a smile on his face
He knows no shame
And feels no disgrace
He's got a look in his eyes
That makes it seem that he's from outer space
Maybe that looney knows what it's all about
He's got something to say
But he can't spit it out
He's unco-ordinated so we shut him out
In case he shows a little bit of emotion
A little bit of real emotion
We're afraid to see a bit of emotion
So we walk away
Show a little bit of real emotion
Show a little bit of emotion
We're afraid to see a bit of emotion
So we walk away

A Gallon Of Gas_EOT
 
I've been waiting for years to buy a brand new cadillac
But now that I've got one I want to send it right back
I can't afford the gas to fill my luxury limousine
But even if I had the dough no one's got no gasoline

I went to my local dealer to see if he could set me straight
He said there's a little gas going but I'd have to wait
But he offered some red hot speed and some really high grade hash
But a gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere for any amount of cash

I can score you some coke and some grade one grass
But I can't get a gallon of gas
I've got some downers some speed all the drugs that you need
But I can't get a gallon of gas
There's no more left to buy or sell
There's no more oil left in the well
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere
For any amount of cash

Two extra verses from long version:
I love your body-work, but you're really no use
How can I drive you when I got no juice?
Because it's stuck in neutral and my engine's got no speed
And the highways are deserted
And the air smells unnaturally clean.

It's got power-assisted overdrive and carpets on the floor,
But it's parked out front just like a dead dinosaur.
And I'll be paying off the bank for 45 years or more.
It should go 100 miles an hour,
But it's never moved away from my door.

Who needs a car and a seven-forty-seven
When you can't buy a gallon of gas
Who needs a highway, an airport or a jet
When you can't get a gallon of gas
There's no more left to buy or sell
There's no more oil left in the well
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere
For any amount of cash
You can't buy a gallon of gas

Misery_EOT
 
Misery
I know you got troubles but you don't have to spread it about
Misery
You moan and you groan but all of that I can live without
Well
Until you stop worrying about yourself
You'll never get anywhere with me
I'll still be hanging in there but you're still a misery

Until you learn to laugh you'll never come to any parties at my house
My house
And if you go on like this the only house you'll ever visit is the nut house
Nut house

You're such a misery, why don't you learn to laugh
Look in the mirror and
Don't take yourself so seriously

Well
Dollar bills could fall from the sky
But still you wouldn't be satisfied
But I'm not going to let you depress me

Until you learn to laugh you'll never come to any parties at my house
My house
And if you go on like this the only house you'll ever visit is the nut house
Nut house

You're such a misery, why don't you learn to laugh
Look in the mirror and
Don't take yourself so seriously
Ah ah ah ah

Misery
You're only happy when you're feeling totally down
Misery
I only ever see you when your chin's hanging on the ground
Well
Until you learn to laugh at yourself
You'll never get anywhere with me
I'm down but I'm still happy but
You're such a misery, well
You're such a misery, well
You're such a misery

Moving Pictures_EOT
 
Life is only a moving picture
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture
Oh no oh oh no

Black girls, white girls oh what a mixture
Looking as pretty as a picture
Oh no oh oh no

We live, we die no one knows why
We come, we go we see the show
And it's always moving, always moving
Life is only a moving picture

Oh, life can sometimes not be very nice
But then you make your choice so you must pay the price
You take the good and bad 'cos life's all work and play
And it soon fades away
Oh no oh oh no

Life is only what you make out
So make the verses rhyme and all the pieces fit
There isn't any time to make much sense of it
It soon fades away
Oh no oh oh no

Life is only a moving picture
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture
Oh no oh oh no

We live, we die no one knows why
We come, we go we see the show
And it's always moving, always moving
Look at all those moving pictures
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture
Oh no oh oh no

It's only moving, only moving, only moving pictures

Around The Dial_EOT
 
Radios of the world are tuning in tonight,
Are you on the dial, are you tuned in right?
One of our D.J.'s is missing.
Are you listening?
Are you listening to me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me clearly?
Around the dial.

I've been around the dial so many times,
But you're not there.
Somebody tells me that you've been taken off the air.
Well, you were my favorite D.J.,
Since I can't remember when.
You always played the best records,
You never followed any trend.
F.M., A.M. where are you?
You gotta be out there somewhere on the dial.
On the dial.

(Are you ready) We're going 'round the dial,
(Are you listening) Around the dial,
(Are you tuned in) Around the dial,
(Are you searchin') Around the dial.
F.M., A.M. where are you?
You gotta be out there somewhere on the dial.
On the dial.

Where did you go Mr. D.J.?
Did they take you off the air?
Was it something that you said to the corporation guys upstairs?
It wasn't the pressure,
You never sounded down.
It couldn't be the ratings,
You had the best in town.
Somehow I'm gonna find ya, track you down.
Gonna keep on searchin',
Around and around and 'round and 'round...

(They're searchin') Around the dial,
(They're listenin') Around the dial,
(Poor station) The best in town,
(Poor D.J.) Who never let us down.
While the critics kept on knocking you,
You just kept on rocking around the dial.
Around the dial.

I've been searchin' for you on my radio.
This time your station really must have gone underground
Somebody said you had a minor nervous breakdown.
Was it something that you heard,
Or something that you saw,
That made you lose your mind,
Did you lose control.
Did you step out of line?
If you're there, give us a sign.

I can't believe that you've been taken off the air.
Think I'll sell my radio now that you're not there.
You never gave in to fashion,
You never followed any trends,
All the record bums tried to hack you up,
But you were honest to the end.
Gonna keep my radio on,
'Till I know just what went wrong.
The answers out there somewhere on the dial.
On the dial.

Can you hear me (around the dial)
Are you listenin' (around the dial)
Are you out there (around the dial)
Can you hear me?
Around the dial.

Give The People What They Want_EOT
 
Hey, hey, hey...
Give the people what they want

Well, it's been said before, the world is a stage
A different performance with every age.
Open the history book to any old page
Bring on the lions and open the cage.

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please

The Roman promoters really did things right.
They needed a show that would clearly excite.
The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight
Threw the Christians to the lions, sold out every night

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please

Give 'em lots of sex, perversion and rape
Give 'em lots of violence, and plenty to hate
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want

When Olswald shot Kennedy, he was insane
But still we watch the re-runs again and again
We all sit glued while the killer takes aim
"Hey Mom, there goes a piece of the president's brain!"

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Blow out your brains, and do it right
Make sure it's prime time and on a Saturday night.
You gotta give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want

Killer's Eyes_EOT
 
I see so little hope in you,
So much despair,
As I look in your eyes I wonder,
What thoughts linger there.
Life means nothing to you,
At least that's what they say,
But it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.

How were we to know what was going on inside your mind.
You never let it show what was going on behind
Those killer's eyes
Killer's eyes

You've seen your picture in the paper.
You're little sister's pinned it on the wall.
She thinks you're in some kind of movie.
Imagine her surprise when she saw you on the news.
Reporters came around and asked for interviews.
So little compassion, so icy cool.
They say you were a poor boy, you know that life can be cruel.
Hate builds up from childhood, your world was a slum
But you haven't got the right to blow it to kingdom come

How could we know what it was like inside a killer's mind
It never really showed, you kept the secret deep inside
Those killer's eyes
Killer's eyes

You say the world is full of bullshit,
So you kill just as you see fit.
They say that you're a fanatic with a mission.
We all go through hell in some kind of way,
Can you tell me what it's like to be there every day?
When you were young you had a vision
Why'd you go and do a thing like that?
And now we see you on the television.
Imagine our surprise when we saw you on the news,
And reporters came around and asked for interviews.

I see so little hope in you,
So much despair,
As I look in your eyes I wonder,
What thoughts linger there.
Life means nothing to you,
At least that's what they say,
But it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.

When you were just a child
You'd hide away when other children cried
But how were we to know
These tears that flowed were from a killer's eyes

I see so little hope in you,
So much despair,
As I look in your eyes I wonder,
What thoughts linger there.
Life means nothing to you,
At least that's what they say,
But it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.

Those killer's eyes
See the whites of their eyes
Those killer's eyes
See the whites of their eyes

Predictable_EOT
 
Don't know why I'm even bothering.
(Predictable)
Yeah, that's the mood I'm in.
Go out for a walk then I come back in.
(Predictable)
Yeah, the mood that I'm in.
(Predictable)
Every day of my life
Can't even communicate with my wife
(Predictable)
That's the word of the year
(Predictable)
All I see, all I hear.

Go to my office, sit at my desk,
Predictably just like all of the rest.
I sit and I dream about far away places,
Away from the people with frowns on their faces.
All of my life is monotony
I'd go out for a walk but I know it would be
(Predictable)
Sure as the nose on my face
(Predictable)
Same for the whole human race

Once we (once we) had so many options
Once we (once we) had dignity and grace
Now we (now we) have got nothing but our own time to waste.

(Predictable)
Yeah, that's the word of the year
(Predictable)
All I see, all I hear
Why can't it be like never before?
(Predictable)
Yeah, ain't life a bore
(Predictable)
Life gets more and more...
Just like I've heard it all somewhere before.
(Predictable)
Sure as the nose on my face
(Predictable)
Same for the whole human race

One day (one day) it's gonna get better some way (some way)
I wish it would get worse any way (any way)
What can I lose, it might turn into something better.

It gets harder and harder the harder I try
(Predictable)
Feels like a good time to die
I kiss you hello then I kiss you good-bye
(Predictable)
Just like the stain on my tie
(Predictable)
Just like the jacket I wear
(Predictable)
The way that I'm combing my hair
Turn on the TV, just sit and stare
(Predictable)
There's nothing happening there

Yeah, that's the word of the year
(Predictable)
All I see, all I hear.

Add It Up_EOT
 
The first time that I saw you, you were modestly waiting for a bus
Now you're driving around in hired limousines
And you talk so upper class.

The cost is high, but it's not the only price you ultimately pay
Add it up, you might have got some money
But you lost me on the way

Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh

Ah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Cartier, Cartier
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci

Add it up,
You multiplied and multiplied but what's it leading to?
Add it up,
The only thing subtracted is the love I had for you
So add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh

Symbols of perversion and insanity
Symbols of social immorality
Symbols of economic cruelty
Symbolize all what you did to me

Ah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Cartier, Cartier
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Cartier, Cartier

Money can't cover up the fact you're getting older every day
And you can't disguise your sad little eyes that give your loneliness away

Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
[Repeat]

Destroyer_EOT
 
Met a girl called Lola and I took her back to my place
Feelin' guilty, feelin' scared, hidden cameras everywhere
Stop!  Hold on.  Stay in control

Girl, I want you here with me
But I'm really not as cool as I'd like to be
'Cause there's a red, under my bed
And there's a little yellow man in my head
And there's a true blue inside of me
That keeps stoppin' me, touchin' ya, watchin' ya, lovin' ya

Paranoia, the destroyer.
Paranoia, the destroyer.

Well I fell asleep, then I woke feelin' kinda' queer
Lola looked at me and said, "ooh you look so weird."
She said, "man, there's really something wrong with you.
One day you're gonna' self-destruct.
You're up, you're down, I can't work you out
You get a good thing goin' then you blow yourself out."

Silly boy ya' self-destroyer.  Silly boy ya' self-destroyer

Silly boy you got so much to live for
So much to aim for, so much to try for
You blowing it all with paranoia
You're so insecure you self-destroyer

(And it goes like this, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Here it goes again)
Paranoia, the destroyer

Doctor, Doctor help me please, I know you'll understand
There's a time device inside of me, I'm a self-destructin' man
There's a red, under my bed
And there's a little green man in my head
And he said, "you're not goin' crazy, you're just a bit sad
'Cause there's a man in ya, gnawin' ya, tearin' ya into two."

Silly boy ya' self-destroyer.
Paranoia, the destroyer

Self-destroyer, wreck your health
Destroy friends, destroy yourself
The time device of self-destruction
Light the fuse and start eruption

(Yea, it goes like this, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Here's to paranoia)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Hey hey, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(And it goes like this)

Paranoia, the destroyer
(And it goes like this.)

Yo-Yo_EOT
 
There are many different people,
Livin' double lives.
One for the office,
And one that they take home to their wives.
He sits in the armchair, watching channel 4,
With his brains not expected home for an hour or more.
He's still drifting to and fro, like a yo-yo.

His wife is in the kitchen, fixin' her old man's tea
She's thinking to herself,
"He's not the man that married me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
They used to laugh together, now he's never at home.
Now she's fighting back the tears, she can't even laugh alone.
She's just sitting by the telephone, like a yo-yo.

You needed me when you were crying,
But now you're laughing I'm the last thing on your mind.
First you love me, then you don't.
I'm up and down,
Like a yo-yo.
Yo-yo.

Ah, you thought you knew me pretty well,
But with people like me you never can tell.
You can only guess which way I'll go.
You got me sussed, but you don't know,
I'm a yo-yo.
Just like a yo-yo on a string.
I'm a yo-yo.
Little child playing with a yo-yo.
Yo-yo, yo-yo.

Girl you had me dangling, like a yo-yo on a string,
But with you at the controls I could accomplish anything, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You were just playing, I was a little boy,
But when I grew into a man you just threw away your toy,
Like a yo-yo.
Yo-yo.

You might be popular, but it won't last for long,
So don't give up the day job, in case it all goes wrong.
Look at your ego, watch it go, up and down,
Like a yo-yo.
Yo-yo.

You needed me when you were crying,
But now you're laughing I'm the last thing on your mind.
First you love me, then you don't.
I'm up and down,
Like a yo-yo.
Yo-yo.
I'm a yo-yo (yo-yo).
Like a yo-yo.

Back To Front_EOT
 
Just come back where I came from,
Looks the same as something's wrong.
And all my friends that used to be,
Have gone and turned their backs on me.
Everyone's got different views,
Now I'm all shook up and all confused.

East is West, left is right,
Up is down, and black is white,
Inside-out, wrong is right,
It's back to front and I'm all uptight.

I've just come back from fantasy,
Right back to reality.
Stayed away too long but now I've found,
My world is turning upside-down.
I don't fit in but I don't stand out,
I should stay cool but want to shout.

East is West, left is right,
Up is down, and black is white,
Inside-out, wrong is right,
It's back to front and I'm all uptight.

No one knows where I come from,
"Who are you and what do you want?"
You've thrown away all that we had,
It's down the drain, it's all gone mad.
The word is out, I've seen the sign,
So you go your way, I go mine.

East is West, left is right,
Up is down, and black is white,
Inside-out, wrong is right,
It's back to front and I'm all uptight.

East is West, left is right,
Up is down, and black is white,
Inside-out, wrong is right,
It's back to front and I'm all uptight (alright).
It's back to front and I'm all uptight (alright, alright, alright, alright).

Are you listening?
(NO!)
Well then, I'll have to do it all over again!

Art Lover_EOT
 
Sunday afternoon there's something special
It's just like another world.
Jogging in the park is my excuse
To look at all the little girls.

I'm not a flasher in a rain coat,
I'm not a dirty old man,
I'm not gonna snatch you from your mother,
I'm an art lover.
Come to daddy,
Ah, come to daddy,
Come to daddy.

Pretty little legs, I want to draw them,
Like a Degas ballerina.
Pure white skin, like porcelain,
She's a work of art and I should know
I'm an art lover.
Come to daddy,
And I'll give you some spangles.

Little girl don't notice me
Watching as she innocently plays.
She can't see me staring at her
Because I'm always wearing shades.
She feeds the ducks, looks at the flowers.
I follow her around for hours and hours.
I'd take her home, but that could never be,
She's just a substitute
For what's been taken from me.
Ah, come to daddy, come on.

Sunday afternoon can't last forever,
Wish I could take you home.
So, come on, give us a smile
Before you vanish out of view.
I've learned to appreciate you
The way art lovers do,
And I only want to look at you.

A Little Bit Of Abuse_EOT
 
One on the nose, one on the chin,
You bruise so easy, so why stay with him?
He uses you just like a human punching bag.
But you don't complain, you're too scared to speak.
Anyway, it only really hurts you when you laugh,
And when you eat.
But you can't break the pattern, week after week.
The bruises show,
But he must be special otherwise you'd just get up and go.
You'll never let us know
Exactly how you feel.
What's the use, the cynics say it's no excuse,
You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse.
You say it's okay,
But I say that it's not right.
You wind him up, but you're living in fear,
You keep going back but it ends in tears, oh.

That's quite a cut on the side of your head.
Is it from his fist, or did you really fall out of bed?
Oh, so uncouth,
Excuse me, is this your tooth?
Why do you stay, no one knows.
Do you really love him, or are you too scared to go?
You're always nervous and on the edge of tears.
You cry alone,
But you never tell us what it's like when you get back home.
No one will ever know
Because you never show.
What's the use,
Everyone says you've got no excuse,
You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse.
You say it's okay,
But I say that it's not right.
Oh, it's your secret, it's your life, who am I to criticize?
It takes two sides to know it's true,
And maybe, he'll stay in love with you.
No one will ever know,
Because you never show.

Better Things_EOT
 
Here's wishing you the bluest sky,
And hoping something better comes tomorrow.
Hoping all the verses rhyme,
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness.
I know that better things are on the way.

Here's hoping all the days ahead
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you.
Be an optimist instead,
And somehow happiness will find you.
Forget what happened yesterday,
I know that better things are on the way.

It's really good to see you rocking out
And having fun,
Living like you just begun.
Accept your life and what it brings.
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things.
I know tomorrow you'll find better things.

Here's wishing you the bluest sky,
And hoping something better comes tomorrow.
Hoping all the verses rhyme,
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the drudge and sadness.
I know that better things are on the way.

I know you've got a lot of good things happening up ahead.
The past is gone it's all been said.
So here's to what the future brings,
I know tomorrow you'll find better things.
I know tomorrow you'll find better things.

State Of Confusion_EOT
 
Woke up in a panic,
Like somebody fired a gun
I wish I could be dreaming,
But the nightmare's just begun.
There's flooding in the basement,
There's water all around.
There's woodworm in the attic
And the ceiling just fell down.
I'm in a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).
I'm in a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).

All the dirty dishes
Are still in the kitchen sink.
The tumble dryer's broken,
Now the telly's on the blink.
My girlfriend's packed her bags
And moved out to another town.
She couldn't stand the boredom
When the video broke down.
Don't know why I feel so bad.
Is it the weather, or am I going mad?
Don't know why I feel this way.
I don't know whether I'm coming or I'm going,
Can't cover up 'cause it's obviously showing.
It's a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).
We're in a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).
I don't know whether I'm coming or I'm going.

Should feel happy, should feel glad.
I'm alive and it can't be bad,
But back on planet Earth they shatter the illusion,
The world's going 'round in a state of confusion.

Standing on an island
In the middle of the road.
Traffic either side of me,
Which way will I go?
I should've stayed at home,
I should have never come outside.
Now I wish I never tried
To cross the other side.
I'm in a state (state)
State of confusion (whooooh).
It's a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).

Lyin' awake in a cold, cold sweat,
Am I overdrawn, am I going in debt?
It gets worse, the older that you get.
No escape from the state of confusion I'm in.
State of confusion I'm in.
Whooooh

Definite Maybe_EOT
 
Got a letter through the post that says I don't exist.
Apparently the new computer thinks I won't be missed.
We need more facts, perhaps you would find out and forward them.
There's no proof or trace or date or place or where or when.
Central Information's got no news today (today).
Is there a change in my position?
No decision, no decision.

All I ever get is a definite maybe.

Head office thinks I'm dead,
But I'm not even ill.
How do I get attention,
Tell me who I have to kill.
Is there a change in my condition?
Not today.
The answer comes with repetition,
No decision, no decision.

'Round and 'round the circle goes,
Stood in line but the counter was closed.
And when I ask who is responsible,
Nobody knows, "Try one of those."

All I want is a yes or a no,
(All he wants is a yes or a no).
But all I ever get is a definite maybe.
Tried to make my life a misery,
But they don't want to know,
They don't want to know,
They don't want to know.

And all I ever get is a definite maybe.
No decision, no decision.

Surely there must be a way to open all the doors,
And wade through all the petty bureaucratic little laws.
Frustration everywhere I turn, I just get more and more.
Everyone's got problems and they've heard all mine before.

Oh, I'm tired of making endless calls.
(Somebody help this poor man.)
Banging my head against the wall.
I walk along an endless corridor,
Then I knock on the door, then I realize
That I've been there before.
No one here can hear my case.
So all I ever get is a definite maybe.
When they say, "no news today, get back in the queue,"
What can I do?  What can I do?  What can I do?
No decision, no decision.
No decision.
All I ever get (no decision) is a definite maybe (no decision).

Labour Of Love_EOT
 
Marriage is a two-headed transplant,
Sometimes that's how it seems.
When the sex wears off it's all give and take,
And it's good-bye to all your dreams.
One head wants to go to a movie
While the other wants to stay at home,
And just like a two-headed transplant
You get the feeling that you're never alone.

Mr. and Mrs. Horrible are an example of what I say.
They used to be so in love, now they fight so much
That they've frightened all their friends away.
They never get visits from neighbors,
They've alienated everyone.
And what started off as all cuddles and kisses
Has finally become

A labour of love, labour of love.
The torment, the worry and woe,
Love's full of fears, bruises and tears,
That's the way that a true love grows.
It's a labour of love, labour of love.
It's a struggle, without a doubt,
But if they keep on trying, screaming and crying,
Somehow they're gonna work it all out.

It turned into a two-headed transplant,
But it started off as "Here Comes the Bride."
But cut off one of the heads and you'll soon find out
That the other just couldn't survive.
Because they couldn't stand to be separated
They're still each other's to have and hold.
And anyone who thinks the transplant is easy
Really ought to be told

It's a labour of love, labour of love.
The torments, the worries and whoas,
The battles, the fights, the bruises and bites,
That's the way that a true love grows.

They took the vows, for better or worse,
And they had it blessed by heaven above,
But what started so brightly as a tender romance
Turned into a labour of love.
Turned into a labour of love.

Come Dancing_EOT
 
They put a parking lot on a piece of land
When the supermarket used to stand.
Before that they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local palais.
That's where the big bands used to come and play.
My sister went there on a Saturday.

Come dancing,
All her boyfriends used to come and call.
Why not come dancing, it's only natural?

Another Saturday, another date.
She would be ready but she's always make him wait.
In the hallway, in anticipation,
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration.
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek.

Come dancing,
That's how they did it when I was just a kid,
And when they said come dancing,
My sister always did.

My sister should have come in at midnight,
And my mum would always sit up and wait.
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late.

Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight,
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate.

The day they knocked down the palais
My sister stood and cried.
The day they knocked down the palais
Part of my childhood died, just died.

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band,
And there's a car park where the palais used to stand.
My sister's married and she lives on an estate.
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait.
She knows they get away with things she never could,
But if I asked her I wonder if she would,

Come dancing,
Come on sister, have yourself a ball.
Don't be afraid to come dancing,
It's only natural.

Come dancing,
Just like the palais on a Saturday.
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to play.

Property_EOT
 
My bags are packed, I guess it's time for me to go.
I can't say where I'm headed, 'cause I just don't know.
When I think of what I'll be losing,
It's hard to move along,
But it's harder just to stay here,
Knowing that I don't belong.

I'll be in touch, don't worry, I'll be calling you.
I've got no plans, I'm not sure where I'm going to.
It's hard to keep from crying,
After all that we've been through.
I've taken everything I need,
Now all that's left belongs to you.

You take the photographs, the ones of you and me,
When we both posed and laughed to please the family.
Nobody noticed then we wanted to be free,
And now there's no more love,
It's just the property.

It's hard to keep from crying,
After all that we've been through.

Now that it's all over, now that you and I are free,
Now there's nothing left except the bit of property.
Started off with nothing, started off just you and me,
Now that it's all over you can keep the property.

And all the little gifts we thought we'd throw away,
The useless souvenirs bought on a holiday.
We put them on a shelf, now they're collecting dust.
We never needed them, but they outlasted us.

Don't Forget To Dance_EOT
 
You look out of your window,
Into the night.
Could be rain, could be snow,
But it can't feel as cold as what you're feeling inside.

And all of you friends are either married, vanished,
Or just left alone.
But that's no reason to just stop living.
That's no excuse to just give in to a sad and lonely heart.

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Don't forget to smile.
Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Forget it for a while.

'Cause darling, darling,
I bet you danced a good one in your time.
And if this were a party
I'd really make sure the next one would be mine.
Yes, you with the broken heart.

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Don't forget to smile.
Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Forget it for a while.

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Forget it for a while.

You walk down the street
And all the young punks whistle at you.
A nice bit of old,
Just goes to show what you can achieve
With the right attitude.
As you pass them by
They whisper their remarks one to another,
And you give them the eye
Even that you know that you could be their mother.
You do the thing you love the best.
What separates you from the rest,
And what you love to do the most?
And when they ask me how you dance,
I say that you dance real close.

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Don't forget to dance.

Young Conservatives_EOT
 
Have you heard the word?
The revolution's over.
Now the anger's disappeared
And the rebels are much older.
And the schools and universities
Are turning out a brand new breed of young conservatives.

Get yourself a brand new scene,
Keep your collars white and clean,
It's time to come and join the young conservatives.

Revolution used to be cool,
But now it's out of fashion.
Politeness is the rule,
And not an angry young man's passion.
And they've used up all the alternatives,
And they're rushing down the street to join
The young conservatives.
Conservatives.

Ban the bomb, oh how contemporary,
In your parents' car.
Another chip off the block, is that all that you are?
Look at all the young conservatives
Hanging out in the bars.
It's got to stop before it goes to fa-fa-fa-fa-far.

Get yourself some new attire,
Set your sights a little higher,
You're going to join the young conservatives.

The establishment is winning,
Now the battle's nearly won.
The rebels are conforming,
See the father, now the sons.
All the urgency and energy
Have turned into complacency,
Now the schools and universities are turning out a
Brand new breed of young conservatives.
Conservatives.

Rebel, rebel found a cause,
Now it's Hampstead not East End
And now he's such a well respected man.
The only action that you see
Is in the Sunday Times.
Content to sit in bed and read between the lines.

Rebel, rebel join the young conservatives.
Be a devil join the new conservatives.

It's a victory for order
Now they've beaten everyone.
The rebels are too old now,
And the young just want to be young.
All the urgency and energy
Have turned into complacency.
Now the schools and universities are turning out a
Brand new breed of young conservatives.
Conservatives.

Look at all the young conservatives.
Look at all the young conservatives.

Heart Of Gold_EOT
 
Growing up isn't easy to do,
Especially for one who always knew,
You would always come up second best.
Is that why you have such bitterness?

The apple of your father's eye,
And always by your brother's side.
Then a little sister came along,
And you found all the affection suddenly gone.

But underneath that cold exterior
I know you've got a heart of gold.
So aloof, so superior,
But you've got a heart of gold.

Watch out, don't get caught in the crossfire.
Watch out, she's still growing up, she's in a rage,
I guess she's reached that difficult age.

Growing up is very hard to do,
Everybody watching your every move.
Your private life always on view,
But jealously never really suited you.
But I know that

Underneath that rude exterior,
There's got to be a heart of gold.
Underneath that hard exterior,
Is a little girl waiting to be told,
You've got a heart of gold.
She's got a heart of gold.

I couldn't understand your attitude.
I only wanted to take a photograph of you,
But I was shocked when I heard what you had to say.
You picked up my camera, threw it away,
I didn't really mean to ruin your day.

Now I see you've got a little girl of your own.
Little princess suddenly grown,
And there's a man, he's smiling at you.
He must have been the one who always knew.
You had a heart of gold.

Underneath that rude exterior,
You've got a heart of gold.
So aloof, so superior,
But you've got a heart of gold.
Underneath that rude exterior,
You've got a heart of gold.
Underneath that hard exterior,
You've got a heart of gold.

Watch her, she'll give you a broadside,
But I know that inside,
She got a heart of gold.

Cliches Of The World (B Movie)_EOT
 
Sunset over the high-rise,
By a motorway,
A little man looks up at the sky.
An uneventful end to a wasted day.
Close-up on the man at the window,
Looking at the street down below.
It's obvious he's got things on his mind.
He shakes his head, pulls down the blind.

He start's writing a letter,
To make it perfectly clear.
He's just a man who's reached the end of his rope,
Expressing his doubts and his fears.
In a world, feels so lonely and afraid,
Disillusioned by the promises they made,
It's a pity that it ended up this way,
Life is just a cliche.

I'm gonna do tomorrow
What I did yesterday.
It's such a dull routine,
Somebody cut this scene,
It's such a boring cliche.

Live life, day to day,
Seems so passe.
Everything you hear and say,
Just another cliche.

Like an actor on a movie screen,
Living out someone else's dream.
Living out a total misconception,
Reality, a false perception.

It's such a wasted life,
Without any conclusion.

Days drift into days,
His life just slips away.
People so blase,
Everything's a cliche.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
Just an illusion.
Just an illusion.

Moonlight over the high-rise,
At the end of the day.
The little man is asleep in his bed,
Tucked up, safely away.

In his dreams he's taken away by alien beings to another
Galaxy, deep in space.  To a planet where a man can live
Out his fantasies, and experience unimaginable pleasures.
But morning comes and soon the realities of life will
Shatter his illusions, and the cliches of the world will
Bring him down.  But still he's waiting for a change.

Days drift into days,
His life just slips away.
Everything is passe,
Everything's a cliche.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
Just an illusion.
Just an illusion.
Yes it is.

Yes it is.

See the sunlight over the motorway,
The little man, with anger in his eyes,
Stands by the window, looks at the sky.

Bernadette_EOT
 
I don't wanna leave, Bernadette,
But I don't wanna live with the jet set.
I don't wanna leave with you payin' all my debts,
With that alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get.

Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
You've never done a day's work in your life,
You've got no incentive.
You've made a career out of punting off all of the men you've slept with.
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.

I can't get a job, Bernadette,
So all that I can offer are a lot of bad debts
If you marry me, Bernadette,
You'll lose the alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get.

Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
You've never done a day's work in your life,
You've got no incentive.
You've made a career out of punting off all of the men you've slept with.
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette.
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette.

[Bernadette's got a house in the country,
She's really got it made.
Her lawyers made her filthy rich,
She's got all expenses paid.]

Maybe a famous rock star will fly you away,
Then you'll eat him all up,
And spit him out,
With a dash of Perrier.

And when you've had enough
You'll throw him away,
And take him for all you can get.
Yeah, you like it don't you, Bernadette?

I don't want to leave Bernadette,
But I wanna keep a little bit of self respect.
I don't want to leave with you paying all my debts,
With that alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get.
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
You've never done a day's work in your life.
You've got no incentive.
Women like you oughta be locked up,
For giving others a bad name.
Ohh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette.
Ooh, Bernadette.

I think you're sad.

Once A Thief_EOT
 
So you've decided to set me free
I've paid my debt to society
Fresh out of jail trying to make a new start
On the street with a bitter heart
But my past keeps on haunting me
There ain't no chance for a man with my history

Once a thief
Always a suspect
Once a liar
Never be believed
Will they ever forget that
I was once a thief?

I was out in the cold
I was soaked to the skin
I needed a home
And your heart took me in
Then I heard all the lies
And I lost my belief
You threw away my hope
And you called me a thief

So you've decided to set me free
I'm out of jail but you've still got the key
There was a time when I thought you respected me
But somehow you always suspected me

Once a thief
Always a suspect
Once a liar
Never be believed
Will they ever forget that
I was once a thief?

Instead of offering me charity,
You should've tried to put some faith in me
Instead of making me a better man,
You kept reminding me of what I am

Instead of offering me charity,
You should've tried to put some faith in me
How many years must a criminal pay?
Until he's old and his hair turns to gray
You smile at me
But I know underneath
You're thinking
Once a thief always a suspect.

Once a thief
Always a suspect
Once a liar
Never be believed
Will they ever forget that
I was once a thief?

Long Distance_EOT
 
Spent last winter playing in the sand
With the prisoners of the motherland
Damn hotel is feeling like a cell

And even paradise can be so cruel
Sitting by the swimming pool
Trying to keep my head together
In that hot Australia weather

Three days to kill and my per diem's getting low
'Cause I spent all my money calling long distance
Calling long distance, such a long way from home

Am I talking to long distance, can you put me through?
Twelve thousand miles but I've got not resistance,
Long distance, long distance, long distance, long distance

Now the Road Hog's face is turning red
Larry's still asleep in bed
Romeo he can't get no head at all
And the Doctor looks on so annoyed
You disappoint me, Mr. Boyd
And the Electric Dwarf wishes he was six foot tall

Now Romeo's patience is wearing thin
C'mon baby, let me in
It's five a.m. and I've been creeping 'round the hall
Got no resistance calling long distance
You sound so close but your such a long way from home

Am I talking to long distance, can you put me through?
Twelve thousand miles but I've got not resistance,
Long distance, long distance, long distance, long distance

Still no points for my merrymen,
Except Ricard, he just scored ten
Now Road Hog's getting drunk again
And I only get to hold my pen
Instead of what I love to hold the most.

I feel so lonesome I could cry
Count the hours as they roll by
It's day time now
I think I'll make a call

Hello long distance, calling long distance
You sound so close but you're such a long way from home
You're such a long way from home

Have to admit I got no resistance to the red light on the wall
The message said I got a call,
Long distance, long distance, long distance, long distance

Noise_EOT
 
Dad's stuck in the factory, machines are banging all around.
Momma's in the kitchen, she got the radio on all the time.
My little sister's screaming, and stamping on the ground.
And the radio keeps pumping out the same old boring sound.

All I hear is noise.
Can't get away from the noise.
Can you hear me above the noise?
Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you, can you hear me?

Can you hear the noise?  (Noise)
Can't get away from the noise.  (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise?  (Noise)
Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you, can you hear me?

Banging in my ears, in every direction.
Listen to the roar, hear that city[?], poundin', poundin'.
There oughta be a law, hey buddy, turn that radio down.
Sometimes I get used to it and I forget that it's around.

But all I hear is noise.  (Noise)
Can't get away from noise.  (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise?  (Noise)

All of this confusion is ruining my day.
Let the noise be like the sunset, and slowly fade away.
Fading, fade.

Girl, I want to build a better world for me and you.
I wanna pull out all the plugs before I finally blow my fuse.
Wish all the confusion would slowly fade away.
I'd tell you that I love you, but you don't hear what I way.

All you hear is noise.  (Noise)
Can't get away from noise.  (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise?  (Noise)
Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you, can you hear me?

Noise in the street, they're digging up the pavement.
Noise in the air, those traffic jams are everywhere.
Noise on noise, to cover up the noise.
The pressure's building up because there's no way to avoid,

All the noise.  (Noise)
Can't get away from noise.  (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise?  (Noise)

All of this confusion is ruining my day.
Let the noise be like the sunset, and slowly fade away.
Fading, fading.

Do It Again_EOT
 
Standing in the middle of nowhere,
Wondering how to begin.
Lost between tomorrow and yesterday,
Between now and then.

And now we're back where we started,
Here we go round again.
Day after day I get up and I say
I better do it again.

Where are all the people going?
Round and round till we reach the end.
One day leading to another,
Get up, go out, do it again.

Then it's back where you started,
Here we go round again.
Back where you started,
Come on do it again.

And you think today is going to be better,
Change the world and do it again.
Give it all up and start all over,
You say you will but you don't know when.

Then it's back where you started,
Here we go round again.
Day after day I get up and I say
Come on do it again.

The days go by and you wish you were a different guy,
Different friends and a new set of clothes.
You make alterations and affect a new pose,
A new house, a new car, a new job, a new nose.
But it's superficial and it's only skin deep,
Because the voices in your head keep shouting in your sleep.
Get back, get back.

Back where you started, here we go round again,
Back where you started, come on do it again.

Back where you started, here we go round again,
Day after day I get up and I say, do it again.
Do it again.
Day after day I get up and I say, come on do it again.

Word Of Mouth_EOT
 
I've been trying to get a message to you,
But the operator can't put me through,
Because the vandals went and wrecked all the telephones.
And all my enemies are spreading bad news,
You won't call me, that's why I'm calling you,
To put you straight about the rumors they're spreading about me back home.

I should have known, sooner or later,
You'd get the news, sooner or later,
The word of mouth will get right back to you.

Somehow we lost communication,
My only chance in my situation,
Is that the word of mouth gets my message through.

The word of mouth,
The word of mouth,
But who are they to say the things they do?

The word of mouth says that I've gone insane,
That wine and women have affected my brain.
Well who's the big mouth spreading the news again?
The word of mouth says I'm round the bend,
It's all over, this is the end.
Exaggeration sure gets the better of people who send[?].

The word of mouth,
The word of mouth,
But who are they to say the things they do?

The word of mouth said I should be put in my place.
The word is out I'm in disgrace - a waste of space.
But if they say it, say it to my face.

People talking, trying to dig up the dirt,
There are so many lies around.
They spread their gossip and the rumors around this town.

Word of mouth, face to face,
My word of mouth has stated my case,
And I'm saying I'm coming back home to you.

You should have know sooner or later,
You'd get the news sooner or later,
The word of mouth will get right back to you.

The word of mouth,
Shut your mouth,
Shut your face!

Good Day_EOT
 
The sky is blue but there are clouds in my head,
With big decisions looming ahead.
The sun is out but the room is so grey,
So much confusion headed my way.
Get positive, try to be gay.

News of the world, tea and biscuits in bed.
The headlines said that Diana is dead.
She couldn't act much but she put on a show.
She always smiled even when she felt low.
I used to fancy her a long time ago.

So today has got to be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day.

Holes in my socks and I can't find my shoes.
It's no surprise that I'm singing the blues.
So many holes in my life still to mend,
And someone just said that the world's gonna end.

So today better be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Today has got to be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day, good day.

If we blow away the past with a bloody great blast,
Make it fast, make it fast.
So have a good day today because it could be your last,
Make it last, make it last.

Will it light up the sky?
Will it blot out the sun?
Well we've waited this long,
So it better be a good one.
Good day, good day, good day.

Yeah, it's gonna be a good day.
Hey baby, if you come back home it'll be a good day today.
They could drop a small atom bomb on the city today,
But if you walk through that door honey, you know it'll be a good day.

And now survival is my only aim.
I call friends and see if any remain.
Who was that girl who used to be my flame?
I'd call her if I could remember her name.

So today is gonna be a good day,
Today has got to be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day, good day.

Hey Diana, I've really got to learn to take a tip from you,
Put on my makeup and try to make the world take notice of you.
Yeah, it's gonna be good day today.

Good day, gonna be a good day.
[Repeat]

Living On A Thin Line_EOT
 
All the stories have been told
Of kings and days of old,
But there's no England now.
All the wars that were won and lost
Somehow don't seem to matter very much anymore.
All the lies we were told,
All the lies of the people running round,
They're castles have burned.
Now I see change,
But inside we're the same as we ever were.

Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line,
Living this way, each day is a dream.
What am I, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?

Now another century nearly gone,
What are we gonna leave for the young?
What we couldn't do, what we wouldn't do,
It's a crime, but does it matter?
Does it matter much, does it matter much to you?
Does it ever really matter?
Yes, it really, really matters.

Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?

Now another leader says
Break their hearts and break some heads.
Is there nothing we can say or do?
Blame the future on the past,
Always lost in blood and guts.
And when they're gone, it's me and you.

Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line.

Sold Me Out_EOT
 
I always knew that they'd get me somehow sooner or later,
But with a bullet in the head, a knife in the back,
Not a pocket calculator.
Sorry mister, you're all wiped up,
You're all washed up,
Sold you out.

Got no dreams, got no ambition,
Can't decide, 'cause there's no decision,
Got no claim to any position,
Can't compete with the competition.
You're always complaining,
It's so depressing,
But if you're old enough,
Start to confess it.
You say, you sold me out,
To get a better deal for yourself,
You sold me out,
And now we want some of your precious wealth,
Because you sold me out.
Sold me out,
Sold me out,
Sold me out.

You sold me out,
To get a better deal for yourself.
You sold me out,
And now it's every man for himself.

Work all your life, put the money in the bank,
Sign on the dotted line.
Try to draw it out, the joke's on you,
Put up the empty sign.
Sorry mister, we're all sold out.

Sold me out,
Sold me out,
Sold me out,
Sold me out.
You, I'm talkin' to you.

You sold me out,
To get a better deal for yourself.
You sold me out,
And now we want some of your precious wealth.
And sell you out,
Like you sold me out.
Are you in so deep, that you can't get out?

Got no dreams, got no ambition,
Can't decide, 'cause there's no decision,
Got no claim to any position,
Can't compete with the competition.
Sold me out,
Sold me out,
Sold me out,
Sold me out.

Massive Reductions_EOT
 
I've been sacrificed in the name of the company,
I've been victimized for the sake of economy.
I had a big house, a big car,
Expense account and credit cards,
But now look what they've done to me.

They're making massive reductions,
It's all mass production and assembly lines.
They're making massive reductions,
Massive reductions.

They're laying me off all because of inflation,
I'm losing my job and my reputation.
Good-bye my big house, my big car.
Now it's all up to welfare,
I hear that everybody's going there.

They're making massive reductions,
Massive reductions to stay alive.
Whoa, they're making massive reductions.

Good-bye my big house, my big car,
Now it's all up to welfare,
I hear that everybody's going there.

They're making massive reductions,
Massive reductions to stay alive.
Whoa, they're making massive reductions.

Guilty_EOT
 
Stand before your maker, it will make or break you
While living for today
I know you, you are a faker, don't try me I will take you
While living for today

Don't stand in the light for the truth it will blind you
Secure in your offices of self-gratification
Deaf to the cries of the innocent strangers you buried
Don't look over your shoulder for the past is still burning
Or wriggle and squirm for your soul has forgotten
Controlling the man that through greed has brought misery to the world

Guilty until you're proven innocent
I'm sorry, but you've sealed your own fate
Guilty until you're proven innocent
Guilty because you looked/turned away

Power manipulators, conspirators, dictators
Drive the people underground
But we'll rise up through the ashes,
To stand where light can find us
In every nation, every land

You buy and you sell with no thought for the future
Controlling the masses in true business like fashion
TV, the media, lies and deception blinding us

Too Hot_EOT
 
Everybody's working out at the gymnasium,
Pumping iron, getting fit, ready to compete.
Everybody working on their own body heat.
Everybody hustling out on the street.

Julian is out there looking at locations,
Arthur's on the picket line winding up the nation,
Sara Jane's working on her way to a degree,
But back in the gymnasium they're working out and body popping.

It's gotta stop because it's getting too hot.
Cool it down, 'cause it's getting too hot.
It's getting crazy, going over the top.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.

All the kids are working out, they're on their way to fame.
Arthur's on the war path, here he comes again.
The city's like a sauna bath, stinks like a drain.
They're pumping up the nation but it's gonna bust a vein.
Tourists everywhere, blocking up the streets.
My ice cream cone just melted in the heat.
And while I do my best to stop my raspberry from slopping,
Back in the gymnasium they're working out and body popping.

It's gotta stop because it's getting too hot.
Cool it down, 'cause it's getting too hot.
It's getting crazy, going over the top.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.
It's too hot, gotta cool it down.
It's too hot, turn the heating down.
It's too hot, the temperature is up.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.

The city lights start shining at the end of the day,
Taking the place of the big red sun as it slowly sets.
Meanwhile back in commuter city, another kid's packing her bags,
And running away.

To a city that is really too hot,
It's Piccadilly and it's really too hot.
Too hot, too hot, too hot.

Arthur's working out, now he's really got the muscle,
Julian's over budget, now he's really got to hustle,
And Sara Jane's living on bag take-aways,
And working as a stripper on the school holidays.
Sleazy town, gets me down, want some peace and quiet.
The police are everywhere like there's gonna be a riot.
Back in the gymnasium they're training for a war.
Think of all the fun we had in 1984.

It's gotta stop because it's getting too hot.
Cool it down, 'cause it's getting too hot.
It's getting crazy, going over the top.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.
It's too hot, gotta cool it down.
It's too hot, turn the heating down.
It's too hot, the temperature is up.

It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.

Missing Persons_EOT
 
Have you seen this face?
Does it ring a bell?
Does it strike a chord somewhere in your mind?
And there's a big reward,
If you help us solve this crime,
And if you recognize this face, dial 999.

Have you seen this face?
Dig deep in your mind.
Has anybody seen that little girl of mine?
She was always a rover,
But I'm afraid to say she's strayed
Too far this time.

Now I'm sitting at home, staring at the wall.
Waiting for the missing person to call.
Waiting for the message I'm dreading to hear.
Waiting to confirm my darkest fears.
She's a missing person, I wish I could see
All of the places she might be.
Maybe I stopped her from being free.
Maybe there was something missing in me.

Wherever she is, I hope she's doing fine,
But I wish that she would phone or drop us a line.
Till then I've got nothing to ease my mind,
And I'm thinking about her all the time.

Summer's Gone_EOT
 
Looking in a window on a rainy day.
Thinking about good things that I just threw away.
Looking in the gutter, watching the trash go flowing by.
Thinking it's Summer, but there are only clouds in the sky.

When I think about what we wasted, makes me sad,
We never appreciated what we had.
Now I'm standing in a doorway with my overcoat on,
It really feels like Summer's gone.
So alone.
Summer's gone.

It should have been a laugh, it should have been fun,
When I think of all the things that we did last Summer.
Now I look back, it seems such a crime,
We couldn't appreciate it at the time.

Now I'm standing in a doorway, thinking of Summers gone by.
It ought to make me happy, but it just makes me want to cry.
I was riding in the car with my mum and dad,
He was drivin' the car, the kids were drivin' him mad.
Dad looked at us, then he looked at his wife,
He must have wondered where we all came from.
And then mum said, "Dad, you know it won't last for long,
Before you know it, Summer's gone."
So alone.
Summer's gone.

I really blew it all, when I think it through,
I really lost it all when I lost you.
Now I'm standing in a doorway with water in my shoes,
It really feels like, feels like Summers gone.
So alone.
Summer's gone.
Summer's gone, so alone.
Summer's gone.

Going Solo_EOT
 
She left a message after the tone,
I hear it over and over on the answer phone.
No one can find her, address unknown.
She just decided to go out and make it alone.

Solo, solo,
My little child is going solo.
Solo, solo,
My little child is going solo.

I feel like crying, I'm in a rage.
I can't understand why she just ran away.
What made it happen, guess we'll never know.
She just decided to go out and make it solo.
Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo.

We work like dogs all of our lives,
Like millions of other husbands and wives.
Sent her through college, didn't care what we spent.
Think of how we feel,
She didn't say, she didn't ask, she just went.

Solo, solo,
My little child, you're going solo.
It's like a pattern, it's like a crime,
We see it happen time after time.
You raise your children, you watch them grow,
Then one day it's good-bye, they've decided they're going solo.
Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo.

The toys are forgotten, now it appears,
You've let them down after all of these years.
Sacrificed all, now there's nothing to show,
Ungrateful youth, decided you're going solo.

Solo, solo,
My little child, you're going solo.
Solo, solo,
Ungrateful youth, you're going solo.

The obligations, all of the ties,
Have got to be broken so you can survive.
Just because they gave you life, they can't stop if you grow,
Now they can't hold you back 'cause you're going solo.

Working At The Factory_EOT
 
All my life, I've been a workin' man
When I was at school they said that's all you'll ever understand
No profession, I didn't figure in their plans
So they sent me down the factory to be a workin' man

All I lived for, all I lived for
All I lived for was to get out of the factory
Now I'm here seemingly free, but working at the factory

Then music came along and gave new life to me
And gave me hope back in 1963
The music came and set me free
From working at the factory

All I lived for, all I lived for
Was to get out of the factory
All I lived for, all I lived for
Was to get out of the factory

Never wanted to be like everybody else
But now there are so many like me sitting on the shelf
They sold us a dream but in reality
It was just another factory
I made the music, thought that it was mine
It made me free, but that was in another time
But then the corporations and the big combines
Turned musicians into factory workers on assembly lines

All we live for, all we live for
All we live for is to get out of the factory
We made the music to set ourselves free
From working at the factory

All my life I've put in a working day
Now it's sign the contract, get production on the way

Take the money, make the music pay
Working at the factory
All I lived for was to get out of the factory

Never wanted to be like everybody else
But now there are so many like me sitting on the shelf
They sold us a dream that in reality
Was just another factory

Working at the factory

Lost And Found_EOT
 
Waiting for the hurricane
To hit New York City
Somebody said it's hit the bay
This is the nitty gritty

And all the bag ladies
Better put their acts together
We're near the eye of the storm
This is really heavy weather

We were lost and found, in the nick of time
While the ship was going down
We were lost and found, just in time
With the hurricane crossing the coast line
We were lost and found, just in time
Oh

This thing is bigger than the both of us
It's gonna put us in our place
We were lost and found, just in time
Now we've got no time to waste

They're putting up the barricades
Because the hurricane is heading up this way
So won't you come in from the cold and the pouring rain
And the old see dog says shiver me timbers
The sky's gone black
And it's like the dead of winter

We were lost and found in the pouring rain
When the hurricane swept across the coast line

This thing is bigger than the both of us
It's gonna put us in our place
We're gonna see what really matters
When you see that storm stare us in the face

We were lost and found
And we beat the fear
We came through the storm
Now it all seems clear
We were lost and found, standing here
Looking at the new frontier

Lost and found, just in time
With the hurricane crossing the coast line

Lost and found, just in time
With the hurricane crossing the coast line

Repetition_EOT
 
You get up in the morning
And every single day
Is just a repetition
It's always been that way
You live alone inside your head
Incommunicado, in the land of living dead

Each day's a repetition
Of the one that went before
Like watching an old movie
You can't sit through anymore
Why don't you kick the habit
And walk right out that door?

From all the repetition
Day after day
All the repetition
It's always been that way

It's in your head, it's in your eyes
You're boring and it's no surprise
With all the repetition
Day after day
All the repetition

They say it's time to start all over
And call it a day
But you go right back where you started
Day after day
You go right back to where you started
Day after day, after day, after day, after day

You look in the mirror
Is anybody there?
It's only a reflection
That doesn't really care
You're a product of your time
Looking hard for something, but you never saw the sign

Lock inside a prison
But that's where you wanna be
Stuck in solitary
And you've thrown away the key
You say you want your freedom
But you don't wanna get away
Then you wake up, it's time for you
To start another day
With all the repetition, day after day, all the repetition
All the repetition day after day
Another chance, another day
You know it's time to get away from all the repetition
Day after day
How long you gonna sit and wait
You're getting on it's getting late

They say it's time to start all over
And call it a day
But you go right back where you started
Day after day
You go right back to where you started
Day after day, after day, after day, after day

Welcome To Sleazy Town_EOT
 
One hand on the controller
One hand on the re-wind
You can even watch it all in slow mo'
'Cos you just sit at home all day
Now you got plenty of time

If you want some real live action
And the video's too tame
If you wanna touch some heat
But you don't know how to light that flame
If you want some satisfaction
Instead of studying the freeze frame

I used to have this spot on Main Street
It was bounding, it was hot
It was dark, it was dirty
But dull it was not
The joint was jumping every night
But now it's just a parking lot

This city was cruel
This city was keen
This city was alive
This city was mean

Till the office blocks and parking lots
Came and closed this city down
I could stand outside
The kids hung round
And the neon sign said
Welcome to Sleazy Town
Welcome to Sleazy Town
Sleazy, Sleazy Town

Everybody hung loose
It was cool and easy
People used to meet and have a good time
Down in Sleazy Town, Sleazy Town, Sleazy Town, Sleazy Town

Then the corporations came along
And bought this piece of ground
The leases all went up
And so the buildings all came down
They built the motorways and shopping malls
And they killed off Sleazy Town

This city was cool
This city was keen
This city was alive
This city was till the office blocks and parking lots
Came and closed this city down
I could stand outside, the kids hung round
And the neon sign said
Welcome to Sleazy Town
Welcome to Sleazy Town, Sleazy, Sleazy Town
City Hall killed off that scene
Now Sleazy Town is just a dream

The Video Shop_EOT
 
The local factory's been pulled down
By an overseas corporation
Now all of my brothers are looking around
For alternative occupation

I was sitting by the telly with my brother, Kenny
When suddenly the penny dropped
While all of my brothers are sitting at home
I've got a bank loan and I've opened up my very own
Video shop
Video shop

At the video shop
I can fly, fly you away

Comedy and tragedy are all sitting on my shelf
And if you've got a fantasy
For a small rental fee
You can set yourself free
At my video shop
At my video shop
At the video shop

I can fly, fly you away
At the video shop
Let me fly, fly you away
From all of the depression in you head
Caused by all the living in the red

I've got a bootleg version of Citizen Kane
A second hand copy of Psycho
I've taped them off the telly so you shouldn't complain
And there's no guarantee you'll get your money back again
From my video shop
My video shop

If you want to escape, I can rent you a tape
To relieve your situation
If you feel a bit low, I got a good peep show
'Cos everybody knows almost anything goes
At my video shop
At my video shop

One fifty a day and I'll fly, fly you away
It's nothing to pay to fly far, far away
I can help you through that lonely night
I've got Technicolour, black and white
I can guide you through those empty days
Make you smile and take your blues away

O let me fly you away
At my video shop
Fly, fly you away

Another factory's been knocked down
But nobody ever complains
And all of my brothers are customers now
We all play video games
I can see it in the eyes of all the lonely wives
If they're bored and they feel like a change
I do sales, rentals, even a swop
And if you feel like a change, well it can all be arranged
At my video shop
At my video shop
At my video shop

At my video shop
Let me fly, fly you away

And everyone who walks in through that door
Has got something that they're looking for
At my video shop
At my video shop
At the video shop
I can fly, fly you away

At the video shop
Let me fly, fly you away
Oh, at the video shop

Oh, at the video shop
Oh, at the video shop

Rock 'N' Roll Cities_EOT
 
Rock 'n' roll cities, look out here we come
From Buffalo to the Gulf of Mexico
Rock 'n' roll cities, look out for our bus
Does anybody know the way to Idaho?

Well it's good to be back
Had some trouble on the way
I never thought we'd get here
But we made it just the same
The flight over was real rough
So could you lead me to a beer
I see the pretty girls getting younger
Every year

Rock 'n' roll cities, look out here we come
From New York State to the Gulf of Mexico
Rock 'n' roll cities, look out for our bus
Does anybody know the way to Idaho?

WCVR KONK, WSOS, are we still on that playlist?
Well, it's anybody's guess
But what does it matter when you're out on the town
Rock 'n' roll cities, with a pizza to go
Rock 'n' roll cities, Philadelphia P.A.
I got my radio
Promo for MTV

What's next on the itinerary?  Can anybody tell?
What's the hotel like?  Is there cable T.V. as well?
Get up with a headache, fall asleep on the plane
And we get there, start all over again

Rock 'n' roll cities, look out we're coming through

How Are You_EOT
 
It's been a while, I haven't seen you for at least
A year or more, or is it less?  I can't be sure
Well, anyway, you must have heard about the
Troubles that I had, but somehow I got through
I always managed to... and by the way
How are you?
How is your life?
How is it going?
Are you still dreaming and making big plans?
How are the nights are they still lonely?
Are you still struggling the way that I am?  Oh
How, how are you?  How are you?

You always said that you would try to change
Turn a new leaf and start all over again
But I bet you're making all the same mistakes
You're a lot like me, that's why I'm still your friend
Still no offence, no more hard feelings left on silly sentiment
No harm was ever felt or ever meant
You go your way, I'm bound to see you on the street again some day
And when I do I'll always say
How are you?  How are you?

How is your life?  How is it going?
Are you still dreaming and making big plans?
How are the nights?  Are they still lonely?
Are you still struggling the way that I am?  Oh
How, how are you?  How are you?

I know you're making all the same mistakes
You're a lot like me that's why I'm still your friend
I bet go, I gotta thousand little things I better do
Ah, but it was really good to talk to you
Be on my way, I'm bound to see you on the street again someday
And when I do I'll say
How are you?  How are you?

How is your life?  How is it going?
Are you still dreaming and making big plans?
How are the nights?  Are they still lonely?
Are you still struggling the way that I am?  Oh
How, how are you?  How are you?

Think Visual_EOT
 
Productivity is getting higher and higher oh, oh, yeh
But profitability is getting tighter and tighter oh, oh, yeh
When you see our face in the market place we gotta clean cut image to keep
(The competition is getting tighter and tighter)
We gotta advertise, we gotta merchandise, ooh, oh, yeh
Flash those teeth
Competition's on the rise
Open those eyes better get computerised
Think visual, think visual, think visual
Think visual, think visual, show your personality
Marketing says we gotta merchandise
But economy says we gotta minimise huh -
We gotta budget to face and the marketplace is full of competition, competition
Think digital, synthisise, computerise, think visual
Productivity, marketability, higher and higher
Flash those teeth, open those eyes
Think visual, think visual
Flash those teeth, competitions on the rise
Open those eyes, better get computerised
Think visual, think visual, think visual
Think visual, think visual, push the button and see
Marketing say we gotta goal to chase
But economy says we gotta budget to face
Get your attitude straight, 'Cos it's all in your mind
And it's never too late to get a new design
And if you wanna compete you gotta visualise

Flash those teeth, come on open those eyes
Think visual

Natural Gift_EOT
 
See that girl walkin' down the street
She looks like a prima donna
She's a star in her head and the world's at her feet
She looks at you twice and your heart skips a beat
She didn't learn it at high school or from a glossy magazine
You see she's a natural, she gotta natural gift
You gotta rise above your stupidity
You're dumb but don't give in
You gotta rise above your station
Discover what's within
And with some luck and dedication and some careful manipulation

Everybody needs some inspiration
Everybody needs some motivation
Mix it up with some imagination
And use your natural gifts, you gotta natural gift
You got natural gifts
Ah, hey, hey, hey, ah, hey, hey
And use your natural gifts, you got natural gifts

You don't have to be a genius to find
All the hidden potential deep in your mind
You don't have to know about nuclear physics
Know all the formulas and vital statistics
You don't have to be an intellectual, you don't have to be a scientist
To use your natural gifts, you got natural gifts, yeh
Use your natural gifts, you got natural gifts
You gotta stop this depression you're in now
Stop this emotional rift, you need a psychological lift now
Everybody needs some inspiration, everybody needs some motivation
Mix it up with some imagination and use your natural gifts
There are bad people, mad people, bitter people, scared people
Wanna put you down and keep you in your place
But you gotta chance to break out, you gotta chance to get out
And use your natural gifts

Killing Time_EOT
 
Everybody's going somewhere
See how they stand in line
All complaining their lives are unfair
Too bad for them, too bad for mine

(It's the killing time) From now till then
(Killing time), Not knowing when

They're watching me, I'm watching them
Standing by the empty mine
(Killing time)

It's a killing time
I know it well
Killing time
Until the bell
Too late to change, too soon to tell
And in between, the killing time
(Killing time) Giving me hell

Up above the stars still shine
Through the poverty and grime
Of the empty streets below
Killing time, nowhere to go
(Killing time)

Tell me, brother what's the plan?
Will I be a working man?
And occupy my idle mind
Or kill the time I knew so well
(Killing time) Giving me hell

Still I can smile at what I see
Soap operas full of vanity
So much wealth and property
Side by side with petty crime

Is that all life's meant to be?
Commercials full of luxuries
A man has one, a cat has nine
And in between it's killing time
(Killing time)

It's a killing time
I know it well
Too late to change
Too soon to tell

Still I can smile at what I find
Waiting round and killing time
Bite the bullet
Help me through it
These lunatics will take my mind
Why can't life be more sublime
Than all of this waste and killing time

Killing time
I know it well
It's the killing time

When You Were A Child_EOT
 
We are born to this fantasy
Can't believe what they've done to you
Hard to see all these years go round
Taught to hide all that's true inside

What was it like
When you were a child?
Did you see the world
In a different light?
When the veil came down
Our destiny grew away from us
Don't it make you weep
Can't you see

I believe that we were meant for each other
We'll get along somehow
If they leave us alone
Why don't they let us be
...Just what we want to be
Don't it make you weep, can't you see?

I can't believe what they've done to you
They've got you just where they wanted you

When we sleep, dream each other's dreams
Casting memories on a sea of hope
Remember life as a child could be
Bring it back for all of us to see

What was it like
When you were a child?
How did it feel?
Did your mother treat you kind?
Mend those broken toys?

For in your heart there's innocence
Waiting to be free, can't you see?

When you were a child

Aggravation_EOT
 
Life grinds on day after day.
In the city streets and motorways.
The tension spreads just like a plague,
Killing reason on the way.
Like wildfire it spreads through the nation
Chocking us with aggravation.

Who needs it?  The aggravation the daily goddam hassle.
It's a bummer, who gives a dam?
Bumper to bumper in the traffic jam.
Clench your jaw, getting all up tight
Breathing fumes, stuck in a tin can,
Trapped, trapped.
Hate, frustration, no escape.
Glaring eyes all filled with hate.
Arteries throb, coronaries pound
Aggravation all around.
Like wildfire it spreads through the nation
Choking us with aggravation.
They won the peace, we lost the war.
So what are we still fighting for?
The highway's blocked, is this my end
To follow a Mercedes Benz?
Hey, Mitzibushi and Toyota, who said that the war was over?
Aggravations everywhere, get outta my way get out of my hair.
Another jam, another day, another hair is turning grey,
I wanna scream, I wanna say,
Get outta my hair, get out of my way
Who needs it?  Aggravation, aggravation
Had enough of all this aggravation,
Tension choking up blocking my circulation.
I've had enough, I've had enough of all this aggravation.
While traffic jams and tempers break,
The city streets are full of hate,
The lights are red, it's all too late.
How much can a poor man take?

Aggravation in my mind my body and my soul
There's no solution to it all, it's out of control.
Out of control.
Is it my imagination, am I seeing what is true?
If we are living in damnation,
I'd live in hell to be with you, what more can I do?

I gotta violent streak caused by
We're getting uptight, wanna fight, everybody back bite
Now we can't turn back the future's bleak,
I gotta mean appetite,
I gotta get my daily fill of aggravation.
Don't push 'cos I'm really pumped,
I'm ready when you are, punk.

So step aside, unless your dumb,
I'm all wound up with aggravation.

Had enough of all this aggravation
Winding up, stress filled, mad intimidation.
And it touches all the passers-by.
As dog eats dog to stay alive,
Then moves on through the population,
Till there's mass contamination.
With violent streets all filled with fear,
Pollution in the atmosphere,
The ozone's gone and that's no fun
I've had enough of this, old son
Who needs it?  Aggravation.
And I don't have any answers
I just got an attitude,
Do what it takes just to survive it,
Another day but I'll get through,
What more can I do?

How Do I Get Close_EOT
 
Living in a world where the flesh is cheap.
Body touches body but it's only skin deep.
I can hold you in my arms every time that you weep
But we've lost that emotional flow.
Living on a planet full of emptiness
With maximum exposure full of sleaziness
But the make up on your face can't disguise loneliness
Where designer feelings are in vogue, what do they know?

Darlin' Darlin' how do I get close to you when I'm
Trying, trying my heart is reaching out to you
How do I get close to you?
In this world without feeling,
Where words have no meaning,
If I were lying, lying,
I'd have more chance of reaching you but I'm,
Crying, crying, but I can't get my message through,
How do I get close to you?

Get close to the sinners trying hard to repent
Get close to the homeless wasters and the innocent
Get close to the souls ignored and forgotten by the
Establishment.
People get afraid to touch in case it rubs off on them
Gotta get close, yeah people gotta stay close, close.
People gotta stay close.

Though we seem together, it's breaking my heart.
This world is full of barriers that keep us apart.
Keep it superficial before feelings can start
In a world that's all glitter and glow, what do they know?

Darlin', darlin', I can't communicate to you without
Crying, crying, I can't get a message through
How do I get close to you?
How can I get close?
How can I get close?
Darlin', darlin', how do I get close to you when you're
Surviving surviving in a world that's making us confused
Guess I'm afraid of losing you.
In this world without feeling.
Somehow we gotta stay close.

UK Jive_EOT
 
Another Saturday night and everybody gets together
The pubs are turning out and all the streets are alive
But the people wanna party so they come back to our house
Everybody gonna do the U.K Jive
Dad's got a crate of beer and it's an open invitation
He's ever-so elated and so are his mates.
Everybody's welcome to bring all their dates home
To syncopate and celebrate the U.K. Jive.
Swing your partner to the left, swing he back to the right.
Don't stand in the middle and act cool all night.
Everybody act a fool, jump around, lose your mind
Celebrate and typify the sign of the times.

Do that U.K. Jive
Do that U.K. Jive
U.K. O.K. U.K. O.K. gimme that U.K. Jive
[Repeat]
You gotta swing to the left, then back to the right
You gotta learn to swing both ways.
When you're jiving in the U.K. O.K. U.K.

Mum's all annoyed dad forgot the inflation
He blew all his wages by half past nine.
Now he's bought a gramophone on the never never
And the tally man's gotta have his money on time
But the kids are jumping round
And they're wearing out their leather
Driving all the neighbours out of their minds
Make a noise with boys and girls of the nation
That's the explanation of the U.K. Jive.

Blow in my ear, I like the way you do that.
And that's what I wanna hear.
Is that a fact?
Are you jiving me?
Oh, you bad pussy cat
You'll make papa mad.

Do that U.K. Jive
Do that U.K. Jive
U.K O.K. U.K. O.K.
Do that U.K. Jive
[Repeat]

Now And Then_EOT
 
In the beginning of it all there was the land
And the sea and she sky
Then into the middle of it all there came man
To live on the land.
And then a great nation
Put into operation an evolutionary plan
Now mighty corporations and politicians rule the land
Wish I could remember when
We were more innocent
Than all of those violent bitter men.
The world was much younger then
But we were much wiser then.
Before we were full of discontent.
It's too bad the simple ways came sadly to an end
I guess that's the difference between now and then.
In the beginning of it all there was the land.
We were much younger then
But we were much wiser then
We never questioned why or when
One day we'll be born again
Our lovers and friends will remain
To live in a world without suffering and pain
And I can see a day when enemies are friends.
And there'll be no distance between now and then.
In the beginning of it all there was the Land.

What Are We Doing_EOT
 
What am I doing in a place like this
When it's painfully clear that my face don't fit?
What am I doing acting identikit,
When all I want to do is to be the opposite?
Why am I, why are you,
Who's pretending just who's fooling who
Do we go our way or join in their merry queue.
What are we doing in the pouring rain
Walking hand in hand, I gotta be out of my brain.
What are we doing, is it all for show
Are we drifting along, going along with the flow.
I don't know, I wish I knew
Is it me or you who's fooling
What a bore, where's the door
Are we just for decoration?
What am I doing to you?
What are you doing to me too?
What are they doing to us?
Someone help me, tell me truly.
What are we doing in a place like this
Trying to prove to the world that we really exist
Standing around with all the egotists
Sticking out like a zit knickers all in a twist.
Why are we?  I don't know,
Are we merely going with the flow
To prove, who we know
Or drifting along acting a part in a show?
Why am I going through this?
Why are you going through this too?
What are they doing to us?
Someone help me, tell me truly.

So do we go our own way
Or do we join their merry queue
Pretending it's O.K.
Them or us, who's fooling who?

Why are we standing in the acid rain
Watching industrial waste trickling down the drain?
What are we doing under the nuclear glow
What we all gonna do?  Where we all gonna go?
What are we doing?
What are we doing?

Entertainment_EOT
 
There's been another assassination
T.V. cameras moving in.
To shoot the bloodstains on the pavement
And get them on the News at Ten.
Will he live or will he die, before we go on the air?
Yes, the networks are all there, in the name of
Entertainment.

Superstar psycho, from a killer to a hero,
An overnight sensation on the lips of all the nation
Is he mad or is he sane?  It makes for good conversation
I call it suffering and pain, but they call it entertainment

Sex violence murder and rape. (Entertainment Entertainment)
That's what you came for, that's what you pay for.

Entertainment, Entertainment.

They call it Entertainment
Inform us, educate us with your media machine
(Call it Entertainment)
Tell me what to dream
(Call it Entertainment)
You pay your money, what do you get?
Entertainment.

Real life for Entertainment,
Cheapens my reality,
So that Hollywood can make it into another "B" movie
The vultures get the rating and the people get the thrills
But the victims always pay, I guess they always will.

Sex violence murder and rape (Entertainment Entertainment)
That's what you want, that's what they need,
That's what you came for, that's what your paying for.

They call it Entertainment (Call it Entertainment)
Inform us, educate us with your media machine,
(Call it Entertainment)
Tell me what to dream
(Call it Entertainment)
You pay your money, what do you get?

Entertainment, Entertainment.

War Is Over_EOT
 
Old soldiers talk about the battles fought
To build a better world for me and you.
They sacrificed their lives to make a dream come true.
Now they're forgotten men remembered by so few.

But the war is over and the fighting ended many years ago.
The war is over.  The battle's won but what is there to show?
Side by side they marched together fighting so their children
Could be free,
To build a better world, a new society
All classes unified to live in harmony

Now the war is over so let's forget and leave the past alone.
The war is over, it's time for all the soldiers to go home.

Rich men, poor men make history,
Fighting for the land of hope and glory
A nation's voice will sing as one,
A battle cry until we've won

The was is over and the patriotic comrades are no more.
The war is over
Now they're going home to live just like before.

Arm in arm we sang our patriotic songs of love and sentiment.
Tears of joy to hide the sorrow,
New tomorrows till we meet again,
With a new world to build we'll say auf weidersein.
What did they do for us?
What did it prove to us?
As we stand beside the silent grave
The unknown soldier can't be saved.

The war is over
The war is over, it's time for all the soldiers to go home.
The war is over.

Down All The Days (To 1992)_EOT
 
Down all the days
Though the past is just a blink away,
The future waits for me and you,
Down all the days to 1992

Here is hope for all the people
And generations yet to come,
An the future's bright tomorrow,
Illuminated by the morning sun.
Here's for all the working people
And me the ordinary man
For assembly workers in the factory
For farmers toiling on the land

Down all the days
All nations will unite as one
A new horizon clear to view
Down all the days to 1992

So lonely on this island ever since she set me free.
Breaking out of my isolation
Reaching out with hands across the sea
Down all the days, down all the days

Hello my Celt and Gaelic ladies.
Bonsoir my green colleen from Ireland
Wilkommen Deutch and Dutch and Dansk
Gutten tag amour prego ola combien

I'm losing all my bitterness
It's time to find some happiness
Around the earth, the sky, the sea
Down all the days

Bon soir, my little senorita, c'est magnifique
Au revoir, my little fraulfin baby, it's so tragique
Achtung parlez vous Englese, bon appetit
Jawohl, mambo Italiano, ca va, O.K. I'm on my way
Down all the days.

Can we heal the wounds of many wars?
And the battle scars that went before
Down all the days to 1992
There's gonna be a celebration in 1992
Somehow we lost communication
But I'll find you girl and come back home to you
Down all the days
There's gonna be a celebration in 1992
Somehow we lost communication
I'll find you girl and come back home to you
Down all the days.
Around the earth, the sky, the sea, down all the days
Around the earth, the sky, the sea, down all the days

Loony Balloon_EOT
 
The world's spinning round like a looney balloon
Heading for a collision with Saturn and Mars
And we're narrowly missing the man in the moon,
Spinning out of control crashing into the stars.
Have we all lost our gravity, reason and sanity?
Is this the price that we pay?
Have we now lost our way on this looney balloon?

Drift away, just drift away.
It's so easy to just drift away.
Drift away, just drift away.
Drifting away on this looney balloon.

The air is running out, the computer's gone down.
The mechanic just panicked, he's nowhere to be found.
So automatic control is just spinning us round
No point screaming in space, you just can't hear a sound.
Now the pilot's gone mad, he just jumped overboard
With a lunatic smile on his face
And he laughed as he cut the umbilical chord
Now he's drifting forever in space.

Drift away, just drift away.
It's so easy to just drift away.
Drift away, just drift away
Drifting away on this looney balloon.
We're out of control on this looney balloon
Narrowly missing the planets and stars.
Even optimists say that it's all gloom and doom.
We've got to get somewhere or hit something soon.
First class and economy, we all played the game
For selfish profit and gain.
So together we'll all go insane on this looney balloon.

Drift away, hey, just drift away,
Drifting away on this looney balloon.
Drift away, hey, just drift away.
Drifting away on this looney balloon.
Drift away, hey,
Drift away.  Drift away.

Dear Margaret_EOT
 
Dear Margaret I beg of you
Dear Margaret gonna tell on you
Don't want to be patronized
By those lying eyes
Dear Margaret I wanted you

You're warming me up
So you can leave me cold
Kissin' up to the rich
Intending to control
All the money money money
Is that all you live for
You're a model and example
Of a greed that will destroy

Dear Margaret I beg of you
Don't you like Rock 'n' Roll
Dear Margaret gonna tell on you
I like your wiggle when you walk
Dear Margaret I trusted you
Don't you let me down
Dear Margaret I wanted you

You had me living the illusion
To be a millionaire
Investing in stocks
Look at you now stringin' other guys along
You're into swinging
Now the money is all gone

Dear Margaret I beg of you
Don't you like Rock 'n' Roll
Dear Margaret I trusted you

Your economic growth
And your cool suntan
But what have you done to your fellow man
You've betrated us all with just a
Wave of your hand
What good is prosperity
When it starves the soul in man

Dear Margaret I beg of you
Don't you like Rock 'n' Roll
Dear Margaret gonna tell on you
I like your wiggle when you walk

Don't want to be patronized
By those lying eyes
Dear Margaret I trusted you
Don't you let me down
Dear Margaret I wanted you

Bright Lights_EOT
 
Time's running out just as fast as it can
She's leaving me cold
I don't understand
Hearts beating hard on the edge of the floor
Gotta kill this pain 'cause I can't take no more

Bright Lights on a cold night
If it feels good then it's alright

Thinking about when we first met
All these memories kill me
Get them out of my head
The flashing lights of the cities roar
Make my mind a blurr
Who's knocking on the door
Nothing's for keeps
Can't get no sleep
My future is late
Guess I'll find it next week

Bright Lights on a cold night
If it feels good then it's alright
She's caught up in the spotlight

See her up there in a New York fashion show
See the freedom in her eyes
Could've chose a better time
For it all to go wrong

Another night and my life is my own
But it scares me half to death
Out in the bars in the village with friends
You can buy me a drink
But please don't mention her name

Bright Lights on a cold night
She's up there in the spotlight
Now it's over and it's goodnight

Bright Lights [3x]

See her up there in a New York fashion show
See the freedom in her eyes
Could've chose a better time
For it all to go wrong

Bright Lights on a cold night
If it feels good then it's alright

Bright Lights [2x]

Perfect Strangers_EOT
 
Everytime we meet
My heart skips a beat
Seems we're Perfect Strangers

I can't understand
What's inside of man
That makes us Perfect Strangers

Through all this time so lonely
All the people with nobody
With lifes misunderstanding
Feel I've known you all my life
There's something quite familiar in your eyes
A soul is calling
Do you ever wonder why?

Everytime we meet
A sympathetic beat
In the heart of strangers
Here the love it calls
But you don't know me at all
Seems we're Perfect Strangers
Just like Perfect Strangers

Ever looked up to the sky
On a night so melancholy
See the angry world around you
Really need someone to talk to
Doesn't mind you feel so crazy
Where's the understanding stranger
Or the understanding lover

I know there'll come a day
When peace will touch the heart of you
Until then I will say

Open up your eyes
You're not hypnotised
We're not really strangers
You don't understand
That in the heart of love
There's no Perfect Strangers
Everytime we meet
A sympathetic beat
In the heart of strangers

[Repeats]

Wall Of Fire_EOT
 
Standing at the end of the horizon
Looking at another setting sun
Nature gave us all these toys to play with
But we've abused them, each and every one
They stretched the chord, snapped the wire
Lit the fuse but can't retire
We're going to the wall of fire
Tip-toeing on the great high wire
Let's have a real fire

The city slickers built the great illusion
Now they're the first to crumble in the sun
Now we're going through the wall
Let's see the flames before we fall
We're going through the wall of fire
Let's have a real fire
Tip-toeing on the great high wire
Through the wall of fire

We drove on many rocky roads together
Through the storms and hurricanes we rode
Unified so no one could destroy us
We stretched the bounds
But always kept the code
Liberals shout and cause concern
Forget next week while we all burn
Let's run right through the wall of fire
Let's have a real fire
Death-defying while the flames grow higher
Through the wall of fire
Let's go through the wall of fire
Running through the wall of fire

Drift Away_EOT
 
Drift away, just drift away
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away
They say there's gonna be a river of blood
It's apocalypse now
So we're waiting for the flood
The ice is gonna melt, the water gonna rise
And we'll all go to hell
So they're keeping us advised
While the dollar falls down
The yen gonna climb
It's a moral decline
And I'm losing my mind
I think I'll just drift away
To that island of my dreams
Live in total fantasy
Close my eyes and drift away

Back in the real world
There's tension everywhere
And the smell of fear
Keeps hanging around and polluting the air
The man on the news is going over the top
Now he'll say anything so his show don't flop
Wall Street's down, so what
And according to astute market analysis
The world's gonna stop
They shout the story to the nation
Pass on the panic to the population
This is the end of civilization
It's all over now

[Chorus:]
Meanwhile, I just drift away
To my island in the sun
Imaginary paradise, perfection
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away
Drift away (drift away)
Drift away (drift away)
Drift away (drift away)

Now all the politicians are running out of hope
They've burned all their bridges
Now they just can't cope
And who do we blame now we're all going broke?
It's that man over there
Who's hanging from a rope
Newsmen winding up the nation
A little bad news helps circulation
Pass on the panic to the population
It's all over, it's all over
It's all over now

Times like this, I just drift away
To my tropical fantasy
Living on coconuts growing on the trees
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away
Drift away, drift away, drift away
It's apocalypse now, drift away
Rivers of blood, drift away
And the man on the news is going over the top

[Chorus]

Still Searching_EOT
 
I'm a drifter who has lost his way
And I'm still searching for my dream
A wandering nomad with no home to stay
Just like a gypsy or a refugee
Lookin' at another sign for another town
Wondering if I'm ever gonna settle down
Or am I gonna keep on searchin' till my dying day

[Chorus:]
Still searching, still searching, still lookin', all alone
Till I find myself a home
Still searching, still searching, just like a rolling stone
Destination still unknown
When all my energy starts letting me down
I get this feeling I'll be still wandering 'round
Still searching, still workin', still lookin'
Until I find a way

This world is full of restless souls
Sleeping rough and living day to day
Drifters who left families wondering why they went away
Perhaps that's how I wanna be
While I'm looking for some peace of mind
How can I find security?
A restless spirit who can't reach his goal
Can't find a home until I've found my soul
Still hitchin' rides and lookin' for a place to go

[Chorus]

Still searching, still searching, still searching
Until my dying day, oh yeah
Why? yeah
Surprise, surprise
Still searching, still workin', still lookin'
Until I find my way
I'm a drifter who has lost his way
And I'm still searching for my dream

Phobia_EOT
 
Everybody got something hidden
In a darkness deep inside
Everybody gotta fatal flaw
Everybody got something to hide
Take a look into my eyes
See the fear and silent cries - phobia
Deep inside, take another look at it - phobia
Everybody got a phobia
Take another look, what you got - phobia
There are alleyways of your psyche
That have gotta be analyzed
Psychological penetration
Of the fear you cannot hide
There's a key to a door to be opened
And I wanna take a look inside
And in the darkest shadow of your mind
What you gonna find?
Phobia

Out under a technicolor ray
It all disappears on a bright, sunny day
But even on a crowded street
Somebody you might meet
Might trigger a repeat of phobia
Strikes again, fear of fire and being buried alive
Dizzy heights, wire coat hangers
Things that crawl and go bump in the night - phobia
Fear of germs
Creepy crawlies that make you squirm - phobia
Images of long ago, memories that you hardly know
A minor childhood incident
Triggering something deep below
Spiders' webs and black cats
Cockroaches and sewer rats
Full moons and witches hats
Creepy crawlies, vampire bats - phobia
I'm talking about phobia

Crowded rooms, too many faces
Suffocation, open spaces
Everybody gotta weird sensation
That they wanna keep trapped inside
Maybe it's a sexual deviation
Hiding beneath a respectable guise
If you are of this persuasion
There is just one explanation - phobia
Started out a long time ago - phobia
When you were small you may have seen a sight
But you were too young to know - phobia
What you got - phobia
Everybody got phobia, what you got - phobia
Everybody got phobia, take another look, what you got?
Everybody got phobia, what you got?
Phobia

Only A Dream_EOT
 
Standing by the elevator
Feeling gloomy and down
Waiting for the flashing light
To lift me up from the ground
Then the elevator opened
And I saw her standing there
She had to be a young executive
She looked so corporate and clean
And I thought I'd seen her somewhere before
On the cover of a magazine
I didn't think she'd even look at me
Or bother to glance my way
But she actually smiled at me and said
Hi-ya handsome, have a good day

[Chorus:]
I must be dreaming if she looks at me
I gotta be dreaming, is it a fantasy
Now I've got positive emotions
Buzzing 'round every molecule in me
I gotta be dreaming, is it reality
But over and over I live that memory
Was it real or only a dream
La la la la

Was it my imagination playing tricks on me
When she looked my way
Maybe she took me for somebody else
Whatever it was, it made my day, hey hey

I wake up in the morning
Smiling with anticipation
Suddenly I feel alive
Face the world with expectation
I must be dreaming this world is a better place
Was my imagination playing tricks on me
Was it real or only a dream?
I see a great big sunset
Where only clouds used to be
Was it all an illusion, is it fantasy
If it's just a dream
It's good enough for me, yeah yeah

Waiting by the elevator
Feeling optimistic and keen
Waiting for my executive goddess
To appear as if in a dream
Then the elevator opened
She was talking to another guy
And I tried to say hello to her
But I failed to even catch her eye
Then everybody crowded inside
And I sadly stood my ground
Thinking life's just like that elevator
It takes you up and brings you down

[Chorus]

Was it only an illusion
Was it real or only a dream

[Chorus]

Don't_EOT
 
Walking 'round this metropolis
With its buildings that reach to the clouds
There must be millions of people out there
Walking 'round with their heads bowed
This city kills me, but it thrills me
Now something's gone and held up the crowd
They're pointing at a man standing high on a ledge
And somebody just cried out loud
Don't look down at the people below, oh
Don't look down
It's a long way to fall and I'd sure like to know
What made it happen, sure makes you think
Must have been something special
To send him to the brink
Down here on the sidewalk, he's clearly in view
Then a voice shouts up to him
Try thinking it through but whatever you do

[Chorus:]
Don't look down
At the people below, oh
Don't look down, things might start looking up
You just never know

He's heard the cries of the lunatics facing defeat
The cheers of the winners
Who are dancing in the street
Perhaps the crime and corruption finally got through
And the violence of the city
Just broke him in two
Now a voice from the queue shouts

[Chorus]

Don't look down, don't look down
Down here on the sidewalk
It's stopped all our lives
People are talking instead of just walking by
Before this happened it was just another day
Now people are talking instead of walking away
Now we're gripped by this tragedy
Our blood starts to pump as we all shout together
Don't jump, don't jump

[Chorus]

Don't look down, we all shouted out, oh
Don't look down
It's a long way to fall and I'd sure like to know
What made it happen, guess we'll never know
Now the sun's come out
Looks like he's standing on a rainbow
He's in the heavens, I'm standing on the ground
Saying don't look down

Babies_EOT
 
Babies being born every day
In a world where there's so much to discover
All the babies crying out from the womb
Not much room, can I come out mother?

Mama, can you hear me call?
Don't drop me now
'Cos it's a long way to fall
Mama, I can hear all the sounds
Outside it's like a battleground
And I'm afraid to fall down
Into the great big nowhere
Papa's had a skin full of beer
Mama, don't let him into here
Baby, baby

Babies being born
Different hormones and genes
There's so many of us out there
How was I conceived
Was it love, was I meant
Or was I just an accident

Mama, what I sense from outside
It's a world full of fear
And there's nowhere to hide
Mama, I feel safe between these walls
And I'm so scared of heights
And it's a long way to fall
Into the great big nowhere
Maybe Papa's getting pressure from his peers
Are you straight, are you queer
So he made me, baby

Babies being born, some are rich, some are poor
But they're innocent and unprepared
Little girls and boys, didn't ask to be born
But they're always popping out there
Falling into the great big nowhere

Mama, I know that once upon a time
You and Papa were rich
When you were both in your prime
Mama, now you got the pains
And I know it's nearly time
But I don't want to join the crowd
I see standing in line
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Babies being induced, no excuse, what's the use
So they're always popping out there
Babies didn't wanna be born
Ill equipped, running loose
But they're innocent and unprepared

Mama, now you are showing all the signs
But is your world upside-down
On its head just like mine
Mama, now your ambition is mine
Don't make me over
Achieve too much in my time
Oh Mama, please don't make me climb
Mama

Over The Edge_EOT
 
Everybody is a victim of society
Comedy, tragedy, vaudeville and variety
Pantomime players in the grand tradition
Winners and losers till the intermission

Girl, I know the world's a stage
That's what the poet said
But I think our weird relationship
Is way above my head
I'll be your Casanova whipping by
If that's what you desire
But once I start performing
I can't easily retire

I'll swing on a trapeze
I'll jump through hoops
And I'll eat fire
Be a human cannon ball
And walk on the high wire
Put on make-up, wear a wig
I'll be your tragic clown
But once you've got me up there
I can't easily come down

Don't drive me over the edge of it
Can't you see I've got mixed-up emotions
Joined the crowd just to be part of it
That was the start of it
Oh, now I'm over the edge
(Don't drive me over the edge of it)
Oh, over the edge

The world is turning upside-down
Civilization's dead, over the edge
Economic turmoil, now the world is in the red
Democracy's a shadow of its former glory
Law and orders broken-down
End of story

My next door neighbour's totally snapped
He's gone over the edge
He's putting up barbed wire barricades
Around the garden hedge
And planting land mines on the lawn
He's gone barmy
According to his wife, he's formed a secret army
Ever since he got laid off
Something inside snapped
His wife says he's gone 'round the twist
Now there's no turning back
All night he waits in the garden shed
For the enemy to attack
A suburban vigilante
Dressed up in a union jack
He's over the edge, oh, over the edge

Don't drive me over the edge of it
Woman, you are gonna drive me
Totally over the edge
Is it yes or is it no
Are you gonna take the pledge
The pressures of society are getting to your brain
And forced you to act weird
And put me under all this strain
But don't drive me over the edge of it
Stop while I've still got emotions
Joined the crowd, just to be part of it
That was the start of it
Oh, over the edge
Don't drive me over the edge of it

Everybody is a victim of society
Comedy, tragedy
Vaudeville, variety
Pantomime players in the grand tradition
Forced into roles that leave them totally driven
Right over the edge

Surviving_EOT
 
Look at us here today
Lots of talking with nothing to say
And if I seem somewhat vague
It's because I'm somewhat afraid
I'm surviving, that's all I am
I'm surviving to be a better man
I'm surviving, that's my plan
Just surviving

Yesterday, I was sure
But today I don't know anymore
Thought I was brave till I saw
My frightened reflection in a dark corridor
Now I'm surviving to be a better man
I'm surviving with an emotional plan
I'm surviving, so please understand
I'm surviving, surviving

There are millions of people out there
Trying to get by in a world that don't care
People smiling through clouds of despair
Protecting the wounds until they repair
They're surviving the best way they can
They are surviving every woman and man
Just surviving with an emotion plan
So keep surviving

Maybe it's my shattered pride
That's why I get scared of emotional ties
Don't let them in, otherwise
You'll smile like a fool
But you'll be hurting inside
So I'm surviving through the insecurity
I am surviving, I got hope inside of me
So I'm smiling through all the insanity
I'm surviving, surviving

I was moved by the way that you said
Don't be afraid, I won't leave you for dead
You took my soul and mixed up my head
You left me alive
You should have killed me instead
Now I'm surviving, that's all I am
I'm surviving to be a better man
I'm surviving, that's my plan
I'm surviving, surviving
Surviving

It's Alright (Don't Think About It)_EOT
 
They want your mind and your body
But they don't understand
And don't care much about it
Gotta work for your country
Society's built on concrete and money
If this room was to vanish
And the toys of man turned to civilized dust
There'd still be you and me, honey
With our history gone
But the spirit lives on

Build those highways, build those cars
On a planet full of scrap metal
There'd better be life on Mars

[Chorus:]
It's alright, it's alright
If you don't think about it
It's alright
If you don't look at it, it's alright

How time slips away
Live by the Good Book
That's what the wise men say
But where does it leave us
Were they right or were they wrong
Gotta have hope, gotta carry on

It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

They want your soul and your spirit
Make them understand
These things they never can have
Gotta work for your family
A community built on trust, not money
If this town was to vanish
And the office blocks were just turned into ashes
They'd be you and me, honey
With the will to survive
And the spirit lives on

Build those factories
Plants and cars
On a planet so desecrated
There'd better be life on Mars

[Chorus]

How time slips away
Live by the Good Book
That's what the wise men say
But where does it leave us
Were they right or were they wrong
Gotta have hope
Gotta carry on

It's alright, it's alright

The Informer_EOT
 
Isn't it strange meeting you here
Two old friends
Just sitting down quietly drinking a beer
But knowing your past the way that I do
After all this time I'm surprised
You'd even come to this rendezvous

They say you went and moved across the border
So it's hard to believe
That you're sitting here with me tonight
I know you're on the run, you shouldn't be here
But do you feel the fear
When you meet an old friend and the enemy's near

It's strange we always go to church on Sundays
After getting right out of it on a Saturday night
And if we stay here too long, I know that we'll quarrel
And end up having a fight
Just a couple of losers putting the world to right

Just two people having a beer
But on either side there is so much anger
And so much fear
Just two people trying to get by
But we're torn apart
Because of different pressures
From different sides

I hear you're on the run from law and order
But you had to show up
'Cos you knew it was a matter of pride
But beliefs aside, religion apart
Did you ever think about all the suffering you caused
And all the broken hearts?

The word is out that you are the informer
Who gave me away without so much as a fight
So be a good friend
And let me take you quietly without a fight
I'll be the one who's
Gonna take you home tonight
I'll be the one who's
Gonna take you home tonight

Hatred (A Duet)_EOT
 
You keep on accusing me
Of making your life misery
But if that's not abusing me, what isn't
You wanna be my friend, well it's too late
My love for you has turned to hate
And I think that it's a permanent condition
You say you wanna make the peace
Smile and turn the other cheek
I can't put myself in such a weak position
Now I'm willing to accept this fate
You and me just can't cohabitate
We agree to hate and that's our fast decision

Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that keeps us together
Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that lasts forever

Driven by hate, driven by hate
Driven by hate, driven by hate
ON the surface I'm a mild-mannered person
That's until you scratch the animal inside
Then you bring out all my animal aggression
I gotta hatred for you that is never gonna die
Driven to hate, driven to hate
Driven to hate, driven to hate

[Chorus:]
Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that lasts forever
Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that keeps us together

While races try to integrate
Nations try to gravitate
Towards equal rights, regardless of religion
Politicians might decree
For the sake of humanity
Love and peace instead of a collision
You and me accept reality
There's no way that we can agree
The world can't make us alter this position
At least you and I know where we stand
We can't be friends, walk hand in hand
My hostility for you defies description

Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that keeps us together
Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that lasts forever

Driven by hate, driven by hate
Driven by hate, driven by hate
Hate's the only thing we have in common
There's no escape, we'll always be this way
So we might as well just learn to live together
'Cos we're gonna be this way till our dying day
Driven by hate, driven by hate
Driven by hate, driven by hate

[Chorus]

If you keep on putting me down
Rub my name into the ground
I'll drag the dirt all over town about you
And if you spread the filth on me
I'll only have one remedy
I'll spill the beans, you'll see I've got a mouth, too

[Chorus 2x]

Yeah, hatred
Your attitude is downright rude
Your jokes appall me, they're so crude
Why don't you just drop dead and don't recover
I'm the mirror to your mood
You hate me and I hate you
So at least we understand each other
Hatred, hatred is the only thing that lasts, what is it?
Hatred, hatred

Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that lasts forever
Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that lasts forever

Somebody Stole My Car_EOT
 
That's life in the big city
You beg for mercy but you got no pity
Low-life zero mentality
Vandalized victims of depravity
Fast food, take-out mentality
Where the dogs eat the dogs
And the innocent bleed
The city can't cope and the cops don't care
There's fear in the streets
It's a jungle out there
I don't want it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't want it

[Chorus:]
Somebody stole my car
Somebody stole my automobile
They ripped off the radio and sold the wheels
And if it's happened to you
Then you know how I feel
Somebody stole my car

Somebody stole my car
I left it parked outside of my home
It had a new A/C and a cellular phone
And I'm as sick as a dog
'Cos I'm still paying off the loan
Somebody stole my car

That's life in the metropolis
Living on credit and overdrawn interest
Craving commercialized commodities
Everything advertised, stirring up greed
Everyday I wonder why
Everyday I can't get away
The city's in debt, up past its ears
Yet we still borrow more
And pay it back next year
Now I'm paying for a car that I no longer own
And the next time anybody offers me a loan
I'll say I don't want it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't want it

Somebody stole my car
It's just been cleaned and I've just had it taxed
It had brand-new stereo speakers in the back
And I call up the cops
With a panic attack
Somebody stole my car

Somebody stole my car
I bet they're riding around and running red lights
Got chicks in the back and ballin' all night
While I sit at home
Getting more uptight
Somebody stole my car

[Chorus]

Don't want it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't want it
Somebody stole my car
Somebody stole my car
Somebody stole my car

That life in the metropolis
Possessions mean nothing in a world like this
Some punks wanna ride and they see my car
So they take it, shake it
Burn it up and break it
Hey, that's my car
Somebody stole my car

Close To The Wire_EOT
 
A hopeful adventure
Got missionary ways
Could start in the jungle
Feel this way
Search for an answer
Over land and over sea
All the mountains
Of promised opportunities

I cried out but you were lost
In a corporate position
So money's the solution
Curing all that ails the nation
But what about the hearts of man
The spiritual needs
I'm staring at the starlight
And I just can't quite believe
That I'm

[Chorus:]
Lost in the fire
So close to the wire
Got to survive
So close to the wire

The soul needs attention
Like the body needs to breath
But banks want investment
So who are we
Cultures are dying
But gold reserves are safe
Can't live in this jungle
But can't escape

Whatever happened
To the dreams we shared together
A taste of wine
A moonlight song that lasts forever

[Chorus]

Feel the expectation
Written in the ways
Each move of a man give away

You look good to me
Sat in your ministry position
An image for the masses
Making serious decisions
Talk about, sham about
For all the world to see
Your rhetoric's a quiz game
And a mystery to me

[Chorus]

So close to the wire

Scattered_EOT
 
This song is dedicated to the memory of
Annie Florence Davies and Carol Bryans.

Like a seed that is sewn
All the children are scattered
By a breeze that is blown
Now the crops are all scattered
We are torn, we are shattered
Now some of us are barmy and battered
And the fields where we gathered
Are overgrown in weeds and in tatters
Through it all we were scattered

To the fields we are scattered
From the day we are born
To grow wild and sleep rough
Till from the earth we are torn
And a soul that is free
Can live on eternally
And the spirit can live on
Though it's scattered in the world beyond
And I've been out of my mind
Ever since she's been gone

I look around that empty room
No sight nor sound
She's left so soon
She's out of view
But the I find
Those scattered clues she left behind
A photograph with a smiling face
A cigarette stubbed out on the fireplace
A coffee cup with her lipstick stains
I guess I'll never see her again

Now my life is all scattered
Ever since she's been gone
I feel older, I feel fatter
I feel the blues coming on
We get bruised
We get battered
But we'll pick up the pieces that scattered
And with emotional glue
We're gonna stick together, body and mind

Ever since she went away
I've been alone to contemplate
Time and space and why world's move
While sitting in my solitude
I've watched the stars and wondered why
They're scattered up there in the sky
And is she up there out of view
On some higher platitude

I wish I knew
Wish I could prove
The reason why this life on earth
Is scattered like the universe
I'm scattered here and scattered there
Bits of me scattered everywhere

To the fields we are scattered
Then from the dust we are born
We survive somewhat battered
To a new life, a new dawn
IN the end what will it matter
There'll only be my ashes to scatter
And all the logical answers
To a worrying mind
Will be scattered in time
Beaten and battered
To the earth you are scattered
You're going home so what does it matter
To an atomic mind
Scattered here while you travel time

Did Ya?_EOT
 
Went for a walk down the Old King's Road,
To see if anybody was there.
But there was nobody home at 3 Bywater Street,
And they had sold Cadogan Square.
And I remember myself in my tie dye sweater,
And my hipster corduroy flares.
As I knocked on doors,
And walked down one-way streets that led nowhere.

Ah, did ya ever think it wouldn't last forever?
Did ya ever think that it would get this bad?
Did ya ever think that everything would get so crazy?

Now the Chelsea Drug Store needs a fix,
It's in a state of ill repair.
And my Cuban heels are hurting my feet,
Just to add to my despair.
La-di-dahs drove Mini cars in the summertime.
(In the summertime)
Now they're towed away for parking on a double yellow line,
And they can't pay the fine.
(Did you ever think)
Did you ever think we'd all believe the hype?
(Did you ever think)
Did you ever think the classes all would revert back to type?
(Did you ever think)
Did you ever think the system ever really got it right?
Oh, baby.

They filled us full of false illusions and promiscuity,
And they led us down that class-less road to mediocrity.
As we walked down that alley way of hope,
We thought we'd found the motherload,
But we were led like lambs to that promise land,
With all the debts that we would owe.
Once trendies posed for tourist pictures in the summertime.
(In the summertime)
Not content with taking Polaroids, they purchased all the property that they could find,
And I've just sold mine.  (Did you ever!)

Did ya ever think that this green and plesant land,
(Did ya ever think)
Would end up in the bottom of some garbage can,
(Did ya ever think)
A dustbin full of promises and half-hearted plans.
Oh, baby.

Did ya, did ya, did ya ever think?
Did you ever think?
(In the summertime)

Now miseries and groaners moan and reminisce about the good old times and whine, whine, whine.
(Did ya ever think)
Did ya ever think when things were really fab,
(Did ya ever think)
That we'd be looking through a dustbin for a dog-end to drag,
(Did ya ever think)
And sleep on park benches wrapped in plastic bags.
Oh, baby.

Did ya ever think that it would get this crazy?
(Did ya ever think)
Did ya ever think that it would get this way?
(Did ya ever think)
Did ya ever think that we would pay the price for being lazy?

A Little Bit Of Sunlight_EOT
 
Tears would fall like the falling rain,
There would be a sea.
But you don't have to cry to prove your love,
Just believe in me.

'Cause a little bit of sunlight is all that I want from you,
A little bit of sunlight,
Is all that I want,
All that I want,
All that I want from you.

A man who can't live with cloudy skies,
Should only wait and see.
Soon all the clouds will disappear,
And leave just you and me.

'Cause a little bit of sunlight is all that I want from you,
A little bit of sunlight,
Is all that I want,
All that I want,
All that I want from you.

All Aboard_EOT
 
Come on pretty baby, don't play hide and seek with me.
Come on pretty baby, don't play hide and seek with me.

Gonna get me some tonight.

All Night Stand_EOT
 
All night stand,
Been around seen a thousand places.
All night stand,
Seen a good half a million faces.

Because I've lived this life,
And I made it for myself.
If you scandalize my name,
Then you scandalize yourself.

Because I'm not to blame,
For the things that I've been doing.
You all say that I'm bad,
And I'll only end in ruin.

All night stand,
With a different girl each night.
All night stand,
With two hundred miles to ride.

But I won't give it up,
As long as I can make the bread.
When I do, I shall stop,
Close my eyes and go to bed.

And forget all this night[?],
And all the people on my back.
Once I'm free from these chains,
I ain't never looking back.

All night stand,
Been around seen a million faces, yeah.
All night stand,
Seen a good half a million places, yeah.

All night stand,
Can't get these people off my back.
All night stand,
Ten percent for this and that.

All night stand,
All night stand.

Americana_EOT
 
America, the land of the free, the home of the brave
That's what I thought before I toured there
You see, I've got myself being seduced by the sheer Americana of it all
And I'd seen their images on television
Of Lee Harvey Oswald, John F. Kennedy's assassination
And I thought "America is a violent place"
And America is keen to trap you
Like you had giant tentacles that wrapped themselves around you
Until you couldn't move and you were trapped
The land of the free, the home of the brave, guns and the Wild West

Hey big fat cowboy, wearing your big Stetson
Hey big fat cowboy, flashing your big six gun
Hey big fat cowboy, singing country & western
Hey big fat cowboy, is this the way that the West was won? Yeah

I found myself in the back of a big Ford Thunderbird
With a slick-looking dude
He looked like a punk from a B-movie,
The sort of punk that would piss everybody off
Until Lee Marvin put a bullet through his brain
The punk looked over at me
"Kinks? What kind of a motherfuckin' name is that?"
Then he reached over and picked up the car telephone
"Hey kid, I've got Elvis Presley's phone number.
I've got Ann-Margret's phone number. I've fucked Ann-Margret!"
I knew Mick Avory would be impressed with this, but I was not
And then the punk looked over at me
"I'll dial Elvis Presley" He dialed a number
"Hey, is that you Elvis? I wanna speak to the Colonel.
Jump to it, you mother!"
And then he looked over at me in a menacing way,
Reached into the glove-compartment and took out a revolver
He waved the six gun around, menacingly
"You see kid, when I deal with people, they have to treat me right,
Otherwise they contend with this! A gun!
Have you ever seen a gun before?"
I hadn't
Then he waved it around, put it back in the glove-compartment
"Welcome to Peoria, Illinois, home of Middle America,
Ice-cream and apple pie, guns and the Wild West"

All American wise guy, why achieve that gleam in the sun
Hamburger and a milkshake, all American dude
Popcorn and a t-bone, hot dog with a big smile
And a bad attitude, yeah yeah yeah

Flying across America on a TWA, flying to California
To appear on television, performing our new record Set me free
The Kinks were met by a union man with a contract to sign
And The Kinks didn't like signing contracts
"Hey, are you The Kinks? Sign this piece of paper guys!
I want you to sign this union-document so you can appear on television"
"No thanks mate, we don't wanna sign a contract"
"You have to sign, otherwise you cannot appear"
"We don't want to sign a piece of paper, alright!"
"Listen kid, you sign the piece of paper.
You with your red hunting jackets and your yellow frilly shirts.
Sign the piece of paper!"
"Do you wanna sign it?" He looked over at Dave
"Watcha gonna do kid?" "Fuck off!"
Which is a fairly reasonable thing to say in the circumstances,
But not very wise, you see, the man was a union executive
"Alright. Once I file my report on you guys
You're never gonna work in America again.
You're gonna find out just how powerful it is in America!"
The land of ice-cream and apple pie, guns and the Wild West

Great American union rules with the fist, a smile and a gun
Great American napalm lights up the sky like the sun
Great American eagle swoops down from the sky up above

And I remember the images of Lee Harvey Oswald
Appearing on TV saying he was a patsy
A union man is a-framin' The Kinks
While I thought "This is the land of opportunity"
But the Cosa Nostra are everywhere
Land of ice-cream and apple pie

Hey big fat cowboy, wearing that big six gun
Hey big fat cowboy, singing country & western
Hey big fat cowboy, moving that big six gun
Hey big fat cowboy, is this the way that the West was won?
Yeah yeah yeah

And 6 weeks later Robert and Grenville and Larry
Were sitting in their office in Carnaby Street
And the letter came from the American government
It was from the American Federation of Musicians Union
"A band known as The Kinks,
The English beat group known as The Kinks,
Are banned from America.
Their license to perform has been revoked indefinitely"
Yeah, all the same fuck off
In the land of the ice-cream and apple pie, guns and the Wild West

And I Will Love You_EOT
 
I know a place,
Not far away where the Sun always shines.

Animal_EOT
 
On reflection, it was not all wine on the wall
It was not all cuts and bruises
Or the pulling out of hair
And the bloodying of nose
And the tearing off of clothes, although

It was really animal, truly animal
There were times when there was absolute compassion in the air
Though it was really animal, truly animal

It could not compare to times we cared
And were in control and less emotional

While the intellect controls the spiritual
The animal respects what's natural
Ying and yang control man's actions
And both extremes are a natural reaction

It was really animal, truly animal,
Well there were times when there was absolute compassion in the air

On reflection it was not all crash and bang
Broken bottles and abuse
Sometimes there were sunsets on the sands
Holding onto caring hands
But there were vampire fangs
As the angels sang
It was ying and yang, oh yeah

It was truly natural, though it was really animal
In a sense it fell into a truly natural romance

Oh yeah,
It was really animal, truly animal
There were times when there was absolute compassion in the air

True love, true love, true love is really animal

Are You Ready Girl?_EOT
 
Well in this new love that you've found,
Are you positive, are you sure,
And are you ready girl?

Though it's fun you talk about[?],
It's the night life you explore.
And are you ready girl?
Are you ready?

'Cause you're living with a man
Who will find no understanding.

Then he'll leave you with a smile.

Berkeley Mews_EOT
 
The leaves of brown came falling through you,
Berkeley Mews, I first met you,
I staggered through your chilly dining room,
Berkeley Mews, I first met you.

Your kitchen sink was cluttered up,
So I couldn't shut it up for longing
I brewed another cuppa up
And tried to sneak out early in the morning.

I thought you had much better things to do,
Berkeley Mews, I first met you,
Drowned my conversation with champagne,
Berkeley Mews, was not listening.

I thought you were an intellect,
But now that I reflect, you left me reeling.
You made me drink a toast
And when you finished I was looking at the ceiling.

The flood of tears I've wept thinking of you,
Remind me of that night in Berkeley Mews.
You know that you left me broken hearted,
Berkeley Mews.

Climb Your Wall_EOT
 
One time I saw you in the street
Thought that I would be that kind you want
Ooh babe, you're the best of them all

I'm trying to tell you how much I love you
Oh baby, please let me climb your wall
Ooh baby, you're the best of them all

Then in the dawn I'll be leavin'
[?]
Ooh babe, that's the strength of it all

Come on over, and see [?]
And let me crawl around on your floor
Ooh babe, that's the strength of it all

I'm trying to tell you how much I love you
Oh baby, let me climb your wall
Ooh baby, that's the strength of it all

I see that I lied, neglected you badly
'Cause you are that one light that's [?] me blind

All alone I've tried to see
Then you agree, let me climb your wall
Ooh baby, you're the best of them all

C'mon sweety, come over here
Let me please, [?] let me climb your wall
That's the strength of it all

I'm trying to tell you how much I love you
Oh baby, let me climb your wall
Ooh baby, you're the best of them all

Did You See His Name?_EOT
 
Did you see his name in the local paper,
Stole a tin of beans,
From a cut-priced grocery store.
The judge said he must pay,
So he put him on probation,
And the paper gave his name.

Did you see his name in the criminal section,
And the center page.
Gave his name and his address,
They stopped him doing it again,
So they put him to dishonour,
And put the man to shame.

He lost his little job,
His employer was absolved of blame.
His world just crumbled down,
Incidently, did you see his name,
In the obiturary column,
Letters edged in black.
Life was much too hard to live,
So he brought it to an end,
In his gas-filled maisonette.
Because he couldn't stand the strain.

La-la-la-la-la
Life was much too hard to live,
So he brought it to an end,
In his gas-filled maisonette.
Because he couldn't stand the strain.

Did you see his name?
Did you see his name?
Did you see his name?

Do You Wish To Be A Man?_EOT
 
All the things you like to do,
Are not easy things to do.
Are you troubled by the bad things in your life?

If you're worrying 'bout a rest,
And you can't get it off your chest,
Just lie down and try to ease your mind.

If your mother comes 'round the bend,
Come to give you a helping hand,
Do you wish to go and bury your head in the sand?

Oh, do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be the one to understand?
Oh, do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be a man?
Oh, do you wish to be a man?

Well the misery is yours,
If you hide behind that door,
If you hide behind the troubles in your life.

You haven't got a friend,
And there's no one to take you in,
Will you come in, stretch and stand up on your own?

When you know that your time has come,
And there'll be no place to run,
There will be no time to bury your head in the sand.

So, do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be the one to understand?
Oh, do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be a man?
Oh, do you wish to be a man?

Do you wish to be a man?
Do you wish to be a man?
Oh, do you wish to be a man?

Elevator Man_EOT

I see winners going places.

Everybody goes up and everybody comes down
Everydody goes up and everybody comes down

Dirty old man with wanderinr eyes,
Lookin' at bums and tits and thighs.

People with warts and scars and dimples,

Everybody goes up but everybody comes down,

Silent madness and depression.

'Cos what goes up, gotta come down

Everybody goes up and everybody comes down,
Everybody goes up but everybody comes down.

Everybody goes up and everybody comes down,
Everybody goes up and everybody comes down

Emptiness_EOT
 
It's emptiness for me
Since you stepped right out of my life
Without a kiss or a sigh
You just left me alone in my emptiness
Just one more kiss, cause I know
That I can't live without you

It's emptiness for me
Now you're gone, and there's nothing left
It mustn't show, but I know
And I'm feeling sad in my emptiness
Just one more kiss, cause I know
That I can't live without you

I wonder who's world you are steppin' into now....
I wonder how long it will last
If you really love him, if you really love him

It's emptiness for me
Since you stepped right out of my life
Without a kiss or a sigh
You just left me alone in my emptiness
Just one more kiss, cause I know

Just one more kiss, cause I know

Without you, it's emptiness for me

Eternity_EOT
 
Into a lifetime of the time[?]
See flowers bloom then fade to dust
I watch each moment sadly die

Time the[?] stranger called me here
Fields before me I walk alone
Each tear that falls is lost forever

And this illusion where time has its way
Stripping away the future
People standing still, waiting for a tomorrow that never comes

Eternity, deserting me
While time just passes by
Eternity, deserting me
Time...
Time...

My soul has touched [?] isolation
The ticking clock of passing time who never stops to see today

Time the[?] stranger called me here
Fields before me I walk alone
Each tear that falls is lost forever

Eternity, deserting me
While time just passes by
Eternity, deserting me

Eternity, it calls me
While time just passes by
Eternity, deserting me
Time...
Time...

Would you walk along with me?

Groovy Movies_EOT
 
Sometimes I think I'm gonna better myself,
Searching for acceptance in this big, wide world.
Sometimes I think I won't make it,
Playing in a rock 'n' roll band.
Sometimes I wanna be a picture director,
And try to make the world understand.

By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies.

All the movie makers of the world would be,
Falling over backwards to have dinner with me.
I'll go down to [?]
Anytime I feel like a game[?].
Or take a long vacation to San Tropez,
And think of all the money I made.

By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies.

I don't want to be a producer,
I don't want to be a big star.
I just want to be a picture director,
And smoke a big Havana cigar.

By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies,
By making groovy movies.

Advertise, merchandise, satisfy their greed
Bigger house, bigger 'fridge, bank loan, get a bigger car
You can sell them any old shit if it's endorsed by a movie star

TV's got a little piece to dictate
They said you'd believe it 'cos it's a #1 rating
You're the products that you buy, the consumer and the goods
And you want it so bad, you'd sell your soul if you could

She want it so bad, she'd sell her soul if she could
And she wants it, so bad

She got it
Now she don't need it

Lavender Hill_EOT
 
I want to walk eternity,
In through the land of make believe.
And watch the clouds roll over me,
And let the sun shine down on me.
The only place that I wanna be,
Lavender Hill for me.

Wish I could live on sugar and milk,
Then I could live on Lavender Hill.
Then I could raise my head to the sky,
And let the sun saturate me with love.

I wanna walk you up Lavender Hill,
Everybody loves Lavender Hill.
Even the bird that sits in the tree,
Seems to sing sweet melodies.
Even the breeze is whispering,
Lavender Hill for me.

While people eat their biscuits with tea,
They dream of daffodils that sway in the breeze.
And every Sunday afternoon,
Tidy ladies shine their shoes.
And every little lady dreams,
Lavender memories.

Lavender Hill for me.
Lavender Hill for me.
I wanna walk you up Lavender Hill.
I wanna walk you up Lavender Hill.

Listen To Me_EOT

And listen to what I've got to say

You know you gotta listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me

You gotta listen to me
I'm gonna take, gonna take care of you
Dedicate my life for you
If you listen to me
You gotta listen to me and do things my way
And listen to what I've got to say

Listen to me

You gotta listen to me
Gonna let, gonna let the whole world know
Never gonna let you [?]

You gotta listen to me and do things my way
And listen to what I've got to say

Little Man In A Little Box_EOT
 
I'm your little man in a little box
You can turn me on, you can switch me off
You can do anything with me, anything you please

I'm your little man in a little box
You can turn me on, you can switch me off
Carry me around, pick me up, put me down
Any time of day, anywhere, anyway

I'm your little man in a little box
You can turn me on, you can switch me off
Whoa....Juliet....Whoa....Juliet

But I don't likely know, and I can't rightly see
How a little man like me can change you so
You know how I need you so
You know how you need me so

You never speak to me, Just look through my screen
You use me as you like, and turn me off at night

I'm your little man in a little box
You can turn me on, you can switch me off
Whoa....Juliet....Whoa....Juliet

Misty Water_EOT
 
By the town of Straight and Narrow,
There's a dark and misty place.
Everything is hazy,
So the people are afraid.

All except Maria's daughters,
Who believe in misty ways.
Everything is lovely,
In a misty morning glaze.

I like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
They like misty water.

I like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
Take a sip of misty water.

Though Maria is not lovely,
She's the lady of my dreams.
'Cause I see my lady,
Through a misty, silky screen.

And seeing is believing,
But I can't believe my eyes.
Everything is lovely,
In a misty paradise.

I like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
They like misty water.

They like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
Take a sip of misty water.

I like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
They like misty water.

They like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters,
They like misty water.

I like misty water,
I like fog and haze.
Anne Maria and her daughters...

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday_EOT
 
Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Ah, the milkmen came in, and that washing machine
It's drivin' you crazy, to hear the kids scream

Ah, but your life ain't so bad
You feel happy inside, it's a crime
That you're wastin' away each and every precious day
Don't be blind

Every Monday it seems so lazy
It's the time that could drive you crazy

My Monday, My Tuesday, My Wednesday
The paper boy's been, and that news looks so black
There ain't time to read it
'Cause you might get the sack

But your life ain't so bad
You feel happy inside, it's a crime)
That you're wastin' away each and every prescious day
Don't be blind

'Cause every Monday it seems so lazy
It's the time that could drive you crazy

La la la, la la la, la la la..........

My Monday, My Tuesday, My Wednesday
Could grab up your money, and run for the gate
You just missed your bus, now you're late for a date

Ah, but your life ain't so bad
You feel happy inside, it's a crime
That you're wastin' away each and every precious day
Don't be blind

'Cause every Monday it seems so lazy
It's the time that could drive you crazy

My Diary_EOT
 
I looked in my diary, no spaces today,
A life so eventful, stacked with appointments too important to break,
Lunch at the bistro, tea at the Savoy cafe,
No time to contemplate the isolation,
No second can be wasted, no space to think because,
My diary is full but my life is empty.
Oh yes, my diary is full but my life is empty.

It's all so contemporary, the sheer pretension of it,
It's all so temporary, but all so shallow really,
Let me look, I might be able to squeeze you in between,
No, my diary is so full I couldn't possibly meet you today,
This evening is blocked out with potential investors in my lonely one-man play,
Perhaps next week maybe when there are fewer functions to attend,
So for now I'll pencil you in,
Between the visit to my doctor, my appointment at the bank,
This time it's really crucial, that's why it's written in red,
My diary is my life and my life is standing on my head,
Oh my diary is full but my life is empty,
Oh yes my diary is full but my life...

I look at your picture on my bedroom wall,
I'm trying to forget you, that's why my diary is so full,
Chock-a-block with engagements but it's only for show,
'Cause I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go,
To stop my isolation, keep myself occupied,
My diary is my one salvation,
Names, dates, numbers, but inside I long to cancel all those entries,
My diary is full but my life's empty,
My diary is full but my life is empty.

New World_EOT
 
Ein, zwei, drei, vier
I wake up in the morning
Looking at the street below.
Oh, the aggravation down below.
It's no coincidence at all.
The war is over,
But the battle has just begun.
It's still going on,
Still going on.
Why?

Mass migration of people,
Lithuania, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Refugees from all over the European continent.
All traveling to America,
The land of the free.
All traveling to America,
To the great city.
Life in the city
Started to get me down.
Everybody pushin' and shovin',
Aggravation all around.
Aggravation.
C'mon
C'mon

Oh baby
[?]

Have you had enough?
Have you had enough of all this aggravation?
Fifty years ago this year,
It was fifty years ago this year,
When the aggravation begun.
It's still going on.
Ein, zwei, drei, vier

Nobody's Fool_EOT
 
From the bright busy streets of the Charing Cross Road
To the dark little alleys in old Soho
From the smart noisy clubs where everybody goes
To the dark little streets that nobody knows

I couldn't care if the people don't notice me
They wouldn't know that I really exist
I'm nobody's shelter, I'm nobody's cover
I'm nobody's lover, and nobody's friend

I'm so use to lying and pretending
I'm nobody's fool and I'm nobody's friend

I can go for a walk on a crowded street
And see millions of faces staring at me
Some of them smiling, some of them glare
But most of them don't even know that I'm there

That's how I want to be 'cause no one belongs to me
I'm nobody's fool and I'm nobody's friend
Nobody pleads for me, nobody bleeds for me
I'm nobody's fool and I'm nobody's friend

I'm so use to lying and pretending
I'm nobody's fool and I'm nobody's friend

Oh! What A Day It's Gonna Be_EOT
 
I can see
Oh what a day it's gonna be
There'll never be another like it
As far as I can see

'Cause the world's gonna know
When they see our good times grow
Oh yes, today, girl
Oh what a day it's gonna be

'Cause I can hear
The birds are singing
It seems a better life beginning
And all the mist will clear

'Cause the sun is gonna shine
And keep shining all the time
Oh yes, today, girl
Oh what a day it's gonna be

I can see
Oh what a day it's gonna be
It seems the very air I'm breathing
Is bringing you to me

And then when our days are few
We'll remember things we're doing
Yes, today, girl
Oh what a day it's gonna be

One Fine Day_EOT
 
One fine day now,

Pictures In The Sand_EOT
 
And I'm gonna spend my time,
Drawing pictures in the sand for you.
And I'm gonna ride the tide[?],
And I'm gonna make a rendezvous.

Sitting by the sea,
Sipping at my tea,
Drawing pictures in the sand,
And writing message to you.

Pictures in the sand (Drawing pictures in the sand)
There is nothing I would rather do (There is nothing I would rather do)
Than just sit here in the sand (Drawing pictures in the sand)
And think of thinks I'd like to say to you (I love you true)
Every single day (Every single day)
I waste my time away,
Drawing pictures in the sand,
And writing messages to you.

(All together)
Pictures in the sand.  (Drawing pictures in the sand)
Pictures in the sand.

If I didn't have a dime,
Would you still be loving me?
While I spend my whole life through,
Drawing pictures just for you.
But I could never draw my love,
It's so very hard to do.

Every single day,
I waste my time away,
Drawing pictures in the sand,
And writing messages to you.

Pictures in the sand.  (Drawing pictures in the sand)
Pictures in the sand.  (Do-bum, do-bum...)
Pictures in the sand.  (Drawing pictures in the sand)

Rosemary Rose_EOT
 
Rosemary Rose,
Nature sure gave you such a beautiful nose.
'Though you're not beautiful as someone would know,
That Rosemary Rose,

Has eyes of blue,
And someone is treasuring a picture of you,
Taken on a holiday when you were just three,
My sweet Rosemary.

You look nothing like a child,
Yet you're such a little baby.
Chewing on your liquorish gum, and cigarettes.
Rosemary Rose,

Carefully sewing on your buttons and bows.
Hoping that someone will be wanting to know,
Of Rosemary Rose.

Sand On My Shoes_EOT
 
As I sit by the sea
Drink tequila by the shade of a tree
There's a seniorita sat on my knee
Sprinkling sand all over me

I've got sand on my shoes
I've lost everything that I'm gonna lose
I've got nothing but the sun and the moon
And the sand that's on the beach

I am happy though my shoes are tattered and torn
Because the sea is so shiney
Ba ba-um-ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-um-ba

I've got sand on my shoes

Thought I was civilized
Till I saw the sea and I realized
That the city life was just not for me
Left my troubles behind me
Ba ba-um-ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-um-ba

I've got sand on my shoes
I've got nothing else that I'm gonna lose
I've got nothing but the sun and the moon
And that's plenty for me

I've got sand on my shoes
I've got sand on my shoes
I've got sand on my shoes
Sand on my shoes
Ba ba ba ba-um-ba

She's My Girl_EOT
 
Never thought that this would happen to you and me[?]
Guess I'll just have to see it through

Every single dress you wear
Never really fits around
A little child with bright brown hair[?]
She always laughs and never really cares

She's My Girl
She's My Girl
She's My Girl
She's My Girl, and I'll meet her all the way

[?] in line she spends her time
A colorful but simple mind
She gets her kicks when [?]
But baby when you ball about it worries me

She's My Girl

Staggering but keeping quiet

Tell Me Now So I'll Know_EOT
 
Tell me now so I'll know,
There are so many things that I could do.
If you tell me now that I'd know what to do,
Tell me now so I'll know.

Tell me now so I'll know,
There are so many things for me to say.
Without your love I just couldn't live each day,
Tell me now so I'll know.

People tell me that you'll just drift away,
Oh believe me, I need you more each day.
You are my hope, my everything,
I live just for you.

I love you deeply but I guess it doesn't show,
I ache inside 'cause my lips can't let you know
Oh darling, please tell me the truth,
You know I live just for you.

Tell me now so I'll know,
There are so many things that I could do.
If you tell me now that I'd know what to do,
Tell me now so I'll know.

The Million-Pound-Semi-Detached_EOT
 
Haven't we come a long way
From newly-weds in our bed-sitter flat?
We skimped and scraped every penny
For a down payment on our semi-detached.
New towns for all the young hopefuls,
A garden suburb with mortgage attached,
Oh, look at us now, sale all agreed, now it's time to exchange the contracts
With the people who sold us a million-pound semi.

Straight out of national service,
Demob suits and short back and sides,
And saw the bomb sites turned air-raid shelters,
Where their families lived all of their lives.
Then the nation built them a utopia,
With pebbledash on the outside, oh,
Look at them now, they've come a long way, they are affluent and bursting with pride.
Soon we'll be sitting inside that million-pound semi-detached,
Detached, in our million-pound semi-detached.
Looking back at the past of this million-pound semi.

Two up two down, a back garden, that was the dream,
Two kids, a cat and a dog, that was the scheme.
Then the kids both grew up and got married and moved out of home,
Then we were strangers again, together alone.
Look at us now, what are we like,
Sitting alone in our million-pound semi-detached?

They're all taking early retirement, the sum total of all of their lives.
Now the country is fat with inflation, immigration has helped us survive.
Once an Englishman's home was his castle,
Now it's a freehold investment to buy, oh,
Look at us now, our debts are all paid, and the Empire has really struck back.
We're the proud owners of a one-million-pound semi-detached,
So detached in our million-pound semi-detached.
A new generation is buying and starting anew,
And learning by all their mistakes the way people do.
Like all the young hopefuls we're buying the future from you,
We hope that one day we'll understand what you've both been through.
Look at us now, what are we like,
Sitting alone, in our million-pound semi-detached?
Look at us now, what are we like,
Sitting alone, in our million-pound semi-detached?

The Road_EOT
 
Sitting alone on my hotel
Looking in the mirror wondering, "well,
After all this time you never thought you'd still be out on the road?"
Like a gypsy I was born to roam
Like a wanderer with no fixed abode
I think about the friends I've left behind on the road

Well, the road's been rocky along the way
It's been a long, hard haul on the motorway
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day

(On the road)
The bed and breakfasts and the greasy spoons
(The road)
The loser bars and the noisy rooms
(The road)
The casualties who did too many lines
(The road)
Wasted talent on women and wine

I think of all the friends I've left behind
Whenever it's time to get back out on the road

Started playing blues in a coffee bar
I took a trip down Charing Cross Road
With my imitation Gretsch guitar
And my head full of songs and my eyes full of stars
I saw a band called the Rolling Stones
I thought, "that's it, I'll get a band,
I'm leaving home, I'm out on the road."

The motorways all over this land
(The road)
Far away places like Wigan and Birmingham
(The road)
Didn't have no name, didn't have any fans
(The road)
Didn't have no money so we slept in the van

All those early gigs we ever played
Sometimes we were lucky if we even got paid
On the road
Pete played on the bass guitar
Liked to get around, mixing with all the stars
But Mrs. Avory's child was all fingers and thumbs
But solid as a rock, setting time on the drums
While Dave the Rave hit the rock 'n' roll riffs
Yours truly strummed away with a slightly limp wrist
On the road

Everyday is when I can't get used to it
Everyday is when I can't get away
Another day, another freeway to face
That's the road

Well, life is a road, it's a motorway
And the road gets rocky along the way
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day

(On the road)
Jimi Hendrix, The Who, the Led Zeppelin and Free
They took the road so it's alright by me
Some are survivors, some are debris
If you play in a band that's the road that you take
Living in it, eating in it, sleeping in it
You wake up in the morning, what do you see?
The road

Life is a road, it's a motorway
Lost a lot of good friends along the way
All the families and homes that I've left behind
To the wives and the lovers and friends who had their time
I say, "you take your road and I'll take mine."
(You take your road and I'll take mine)
You take your road and I'll take mine
(You take your road and I'll take mine)

Life is a road, it's a motorway
And the road gets rocky along the way
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day

(On the road)
Observed all the various phases from
Flower power, heavy metal and acid rock
And still all the critics keep saying
"Are they still around?  When they gonna stop?"
It's just the dedicated followers of fashion who like putting down
All the well respected men who came dancing and are still on the road

Sometime I get suicidal
Now everyone is a rival
Different cars, different bars and hotels
Corporations, big business and egos
When it all gets too bad I think back
When we were all each other had
When we started out on the road

And there's gas in my tank and I've still got a way to go
Another hotel, it's time to check out soon
As I look around the room
I think of all the friends I've left behind
On the road

The Shirt_EOT
 
As I walked into the charity store
I saw a second-hand shirt hangin' up by the door
The collar was frayed, there was a stain on the cuff
Caused by ketchup or blood or some such stuff
It wasn't made of polyester or nylon
The label said "Made in the UK" so I tried it on
And I looked in the mirror and declared
"I like this shirt, I want it"

It's not the label on the shirt that you wear
It's the way that you wear it
They say it's style and breeding and culture that counts
But you can't change good taste on the expense account
And if design or fashion makes you a hero
You can dress all highbrow but still be an emotional zero
But I declare "It's not the shirt you wear
It's the way that you wear it"

I was looking for danger, I should have taken more care
I was dressed to kill, I felt so debonair
Wild expectations, arrogant air
Then I walked into that bar, she was standing there
I walked over with all my savoir fair
And she said "You're a smart looking dude
But your character's ugly, it clashes with my shoes
And I, I can't stand your attitude"

I assumed it was leading to a romantic interlude
I thought my conquest was made
But I was stunned by the magnitude
Of her ingratitude
I spent a good thirty bucks on this babe
Like the shirt I was wearing

This romantic affair was not destined to last
The harder I tried, the louder she laughed
I was reduced to despair, my emotions laid bare
She knew I was hurt, made me feel like a jerk
I was humbled, humiliated, castrated
My masculinity dragged through the dirt
Then thrown in the air to be devoured by the lions
The vultures, the jackals and all the scavengers of love
I was strutting around with my chest stuck out
Like a peacock preparing to get laid
Thought I looked cool but she put me down
She said "You look like a clown on a circus parade"
Still the shirt has class, it looks well made
She was a babe of the first degree
She was totally fantabulous
Like a goddess from Greece and yet
The epitome of the 20th century femininity
She was in her own league
She was meant for me, it was destiny
Like Adam and Eve, synchronisity
She brought out the testosterone in me

Last time I saw that babe she was smiling contentedly
Now I'm trapped on this murder rap, a mistaken identity
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
Now this cop says "It's up to you, death row or solitude
Crime of passion, you should plead 'insane'
You say you wouldn't lie, but we've just blown your alibi
We've found your shirt and it's got a blood stain"

It was the shirt you were wearing
It was the shirt you were wearing

There's A New World Just Opening For Me_EOT
 
Now I know just what I've been doing wrong,
Life seems empty, but it won't last for long.
I shan't go on this way.
There's a new world just opening for me.

Been alive, but it could be lying down.  [?]
Just can't tell when the devil's on the prowl.
I can't pretend no more.
There's a new world just opening for me.
There's a new world just opening for me.

Win the battle, but the victory brings you pain.
You make confessions, but you do the same again.
I won't go on this way.
There's a new world just opening for me.
I won't go on this way.
There's a new world just opening for me.

This I Know_EOT
 
Like the clouds that bring the rain
Like the sun that makes the flowers
Like the soft and gentle breeze
I will blow away the showers

This I know, this I know and I know
I love you for the rest of my life
I can't wait till tomorrow comes
I can't wait to see the sunlight in your eyes
When you know that I am yours

I don't know what makes the stars
Light up the sky when nighttime's falling
But like the stars up in the sky
My love for you is everlasting

This I know, this I know and I know
I love you for the rest of my life
I can't wait till tomorrow comes
I can't wait to see the sunlight in your eyes
When you know that I am yours

When the leaves fall sadly down
When the autumn winds are blowing
They don't feel sad because they know
A new life comes at springtime's dawning

This I know, this I know and I know
I love you for the rest of my life
I love you for the rest of my life

Till Death Do Us Part_EOT
 
What can I do?
How can I show you,
And let you see,
That I am someone,
That you want me to be.

I'm only me,
Not someone better,
Not someone good.
I'd be a soldier,
That's if I only could.

If I were king,
I'd tell my army,
To change the world.
Then I'd be someone,
Like you want me to be.

In my little life,
I know that the world must keep on turning,
Even though it leaves me far behind.
Life is like a school,
But I'm not prepared to keep on learning,
Even though it treats me like a fool.

This is our lot,
To live together,
Not live apart.
Let's stay together,
Until death us do part.

Not just a day,
But till forever,
Just as the stars,
Just as the ending,
Until death us do part.

Time Will Tell_EOT
 
Time will tell if I will drift eternally,
Through life instead of being someone.
All of my life, you are the one, you're on my mind.
Have a good time, do what you want, but you will find,

Time will tell if I'll survive.
I'd rather be dead than just pretend I'm alive.
Time will tell, it's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.

Time will tell if we will be the same as now,
Or not, if not, then never mind.
All of my life, you are the one, you're on my mind.
Have a good time, do what you want, but you will find,

Time will tell if I'll survive.
I'd rather be dead than just pretend I'm alive.
Time will tell, it's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.

Time will tell if dreams become reality,
For you got me, as long as you want.
All of my life, you are the one, you're on my mind.
Have a good time, do what you want, but you will find,

Time will tell if I'll survive.
I'd rather be dead than just pretend I'm alive.
Time will tell, it's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.

To The Bone_EOT
 
In the back of a record rack
There's a old double pack
Twelve inches and black
With an old crumpled cover
But every track is stacked

And it takes me back
To the one who caused this melancholy mood
And every single groove
Cuts me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

I took her back to my bachelor flat
While the stereo played for two
She unwrapped her gift
And played me a riff
And said, "this old record was just made for you"

Then we danced to songs of passion and
The singer's velvet tones
On the gramaphone
While the record played
She rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone

Those those rock n' roll romantic songs
Played all summer long
And she rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone.

Yeah, she rocks me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

In dreams she's smiling in slow motion
Devouring all of my emotion
Angels singing rock 'n' roll
While demons take away my soul

Voices sound, her image fades
Every time that record plays
She rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone

In my back room there's an old 45
That we played all summer long
Shakin the beams so loud it covered up the screams
When lover's harmony went oh so wrong

And in every word emotion is torn
And blood flows down the drain
Like she opened up a vein
And cut me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

And now i'm just a prisoner
In that stereo Hi-Fi jail
The needle pierced just like a nail
As she rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone

Do do do do do do do
She rocks me to the bone

Yeah, she rocks me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

Tokyo_EOT
 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, Tokyo.

Unfinished Business_EOT
 
Took a walk outside, the truth was on my side,
But I didn't even make the corner.
Revolution in my sights, the time seems so right,
But I never even saw it coming.
Can't let it go.  Oh no, no.

Can't you hear me call, bang my head against the wall,
Can't stay around this place forever.
Can't you see, we gotta be free,
We all gotta come together.
Don't let go, oh no.

Unfinished business,
You thought you'd keep me quiet.
You put a bullet in my side, but you can't put out my light.
Unfinished business,
Yes, love's the only way to find peace today.

The future's here today, we gotta find a way,
To put all the pain behind you.
You gotta put down the guns, all religion is one,
Politicians only want to blind you.
Break away, oh there's a way.

Oh, the message is clear, wipe away all the tears,
And build a better world around you.
Got to give out your love to each and every one,
Can't you see it's only fear that holds you,
Let it go.  Oh, let it go.

Unfinished business,
I though that I was right[?].
What that fool put out that night, [?] burn so bright.
Unfinished business,
Oh yes, love's the only way to find peace today.

So you thought you'd take my life,
Put a bullet in my side, but you can't put out my light.
Unfinished business,
Love's the only way to find peace today.
Unfinished business
Unfinished business
Unfinished business

There's a long road behind you,
It's a hard life if you make it one
Come on to the other side [?]
There is no place to hide

Unfinished business

When I Turn Off The Living Room Light_EOT
 
Who cares if you're Jewish,
And your breath smells of garlic,
And your nose is a shiny red light.
To me you are gorgeous,
And everything's right,
When I turn off the living room light.

Your clothes are old-fashioned,
Your knuckles are bony,
Your hair looks a terrible sight.
But I don't have to see you,
The way that you are,
When I turn off the living room light.
When I turn off the living room light.
I don't have to see you,
The way that you are,
When I turn off the living room light.

Well it's not that you are ugly,
And I'm not being cruel,
It helps me to relax, dear,
It helps to keep me cool.
Now I am not intending,
To make you feel ashamed,
What's wrong in me pretending?
'Cause you can't help being plain.

Your nose may be bulbous,
Your face may be spotty,
Your skin may be wrinkled and tight.
But I don't want to see you,
The way that you are,
So I turn off the living room light.

We don't feel so ugly,
We don't feel so draggy,
We don't feel so twisted up tight.
And we don't feel as ugly as we really are,
When we turn off the living room light.
When we turn off the living room light.
We don't feel as ugly as we really are,
When we turn off the living room light.

When The Wind Blows (Emergency)_EOT
 
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.

In a part of this once-great city
Stands a child crying out in pity.
Gone is hope in the heart of each hungry hour.

Every year in this land of plenty
There are millions of starving children
What will I say if they look my way?
This is an emergency.

When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.

Bow your heads to the lost generation
Scars so deep, bringing God's damnation.
Businessmen sip wine while congress argue.

But for grace we enjoy our pleasures
What we face will be our salvation
Go build your towns, but remember time will not forget
That this is an emergency.

When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.

Think of what the wise men said.

When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.

Where Did My Spring Go?_EOT
 
Where did the spring go?
Where did the trees go?
Where did the sun go?
Where did the bluebirds fly?
Why did the rainbow turn into shadows?

Why am I cold now?
Why does my skin sag?
Why ain't my back straight?
Why do my feet ache?
Where did my youth go?
Where did my life go?

Remember walking in the rain,
And getting soaking wet,
Now I got rheumatic pains,
And I really do regret it.

Where did my teeth go?
Where did my muscles go?
Where did my shoulders go?
Where did my chest go?
When you were loving me,
You were just using me.
You would employ me,
You would destroy me.
Now all I've got are varicose veins.

Where did the spring go?
Where did my hormones go?
Where did my energy go?
Where did my go go?
Where did the pleasure go?
Where did my hair go?

Remember all those sleepless nights,
Making love by candlelight,
And every time you took my love,
You were shortening my life.

Where did my teeth go?
Where did my hair go?
Where did my shoulders go?
Where did my chest go?
Where did my hormones go?
Where did my go go?
Where did my energy go?
Where did my skin go?
Where did my muscles go?
Where did my liver go?
Where did my heart go?
Where did my bones go?

Yours Truly, Confused N10_EOT
 
Dear sir or madame, I don't normally write to the press
But the neighbourhood where I grew up is really quite depressed.
Society is crumbling but the media's obsessed with boobs, bums,
Dot com, millionaires, fame, fashion, footsie shares
But people they couldn't care less.

While parliamentary yobbos shout abuse around the house
Do-gooders and reformers lead our nation to defeat.
While murderers and terrorists get compassionate release
You're out now. You're back on the street yeh, back on the street.

That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10.

I close my eyes and lay back and I think of England.
I dream about that green and pleasant land we knew as England.
That throne of kings, that sceptred isle set in a silver sea
Has turned into a laughing stock divided without harmony.

That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10

The burglars have ransacked all the houses in the street
While Mercs and Posches double park with sheer impunity.
When towed away the ponces plead to all and sundry
Referee what about me?

So forgive my lack of confidence and total low esteem
But the dog eat dog society has deemed us all has-beens.
While our smiling bland spin doctors slyly lead us down the track
To a stab in the back.

I'm much too terrified to go out at night but the television's boring.
They're vandalising all the cars on the street
But I won't lay down and take defeat.

That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10

Thank you goodnight

_SOT I'm A Loser _EOT

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

_SOT Baby's In Black _EOT

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

Oh how long it will take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

_SOT Rock And Roll Music _EOT

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

_SOT Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) _EOT

I once had a girl
Or should I say
She once had me

She showed me her room
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird had flown

So I lit a fire
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

_SOT You Won't See Me _EOT

When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

I don't know why you
Should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't have much to say
But I can't turn away
And you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

Time after time

_SOT Nowhere Man _EOT

He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere Man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command

He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?

Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

_SOT Think For Yourself _EOT

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cos I won't be there with you

Do what you want to do

But now I've got it, the word is good

Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine

Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine

Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of

_SOT What Goes On _EOT

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

_SOT Girl _EOT

Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

Ah, girl, girl, girl

When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

Ah, girl, girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there,
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood.
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ah, girl, girl, girl

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

Ah, girl, girl, girl

_SOT I'm Looking Through You _EOT

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

I'm looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Yeah
Oh baby I'm changed
Ah I'm looking through you
Yeah I'm looking through you

_SOT In My Life _EOT

There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

In my life I love you more

Don't wait, turn me away

If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Lives in a dream

Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?

Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there

Ah, look at all the lonely people

When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins, you'll see

I'll make love to you
If you want me to

_SOT Here, There And Everywhere _EOT

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me

Knowing that love is to share

I know what it is to be sad."
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

I said, "Who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad.
And you're making me feel like I've never been born."

She said, "You don't understand what I said."
I said, "No, no, no, you're wrong.
When I was a boy everything was right,
Everything was right."

I said, "Even though you know what you know,
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born."

We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

You say you've seen Seven Wonders and your bird is green
But you can't see me, you can't see me

When your prized possessions start to weigh you down
Look in my direction, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me, you can't hear me

_SOT For No One _EOT

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind her tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind her tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind her tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

_SOT I Want To Tell You _EOT

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's alright
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand

I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time, I've got time, I've got time

Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

_SOT Tomorrow Never Knows _EOT

Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing...

... that ignorance and hates may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

So play the game "Existence" to the end...
... Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

(Do you need anybody?)
I just need someone to love

_SOT Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds _EOT

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters with looking-glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds [fade out]

_SOT Getting Better _EOT

It's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school (No I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Oh), turning me round (Oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Foolish rules)

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get more worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get more worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Ooh)

I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get more worse)
Yes I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time

Better, better, better

_SOT Fixing A Hole _EOT

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesn't matter if
I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

I'm painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh ooh ooh ah ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

And it really doesn't matter if
I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around
They worry me and never ask me
Why they don't get past my door

I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh ooh ooh ah ah

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
Stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go oh
Where it will go oh

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go (fade out)

_SOT She's Leaving Home _EOT

Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband "Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?"

She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years (Bye bye)

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years (Bye bye)

She's leaving home
Bye bye

_SOT Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite! _EOT

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline

The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair, what a scene!

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate

The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late!

Messrs. K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound

And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill!

_SOT Within You Without You _EOT

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

_SOT When I'm Sixty Four _EOT

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck & Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Ho!

_SOT Lovely Rita _EOT

Aaaahhh...

Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid

Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita, maid, ah)
Rita!

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid, Rita meter maid (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Oh Lovely Rita meter meter maid (Lovely Rita meter maid)
Ah da, ah da (Lovely Rita meter maid)

[Leave it.]

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street

After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing is changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

_SOT A Day In The Life _EOT

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car;
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy;
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on

_SOT The Fool On The Hill _EOT

Day after day, alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

_SOT Blue Jay Way _EOT

There's a fog upon L.A.,
And my friends have lost their way.
"We'll be over soon," they said.
Now they've lost themselves instead

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long for I may be asleep

Well, it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long for I may be asleep

Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long for I may be asleep

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't you be very long

Don't you think the joker laughs at you?

_SOT Penny Lane _EOT

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

Well...

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
[LOVE version:] I look from the wings at the play you are staging.
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all

Still my guitar gently weeps

Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime

You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane

Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down

And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able

And now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible

They'd get a little bit older and a litter slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen your father's giving it diddly-i-dee

So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the fucking navy and went to sea

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The twist

Eldorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

Maybe even then
Impervious in London
Could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked

If you became naked

_SOT Yellow Submarine _EOT

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

{Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain [pronounced bo'sun], full speed ahead!
Full speed it is, Sgt.!
Cut the cable, drop the cable!
Aye, sir, aye!
Captain, captain! [pronounced cap'n, cap'n]}

As we live a life of ease (A life of ease)
Everyone of us (Everyone of us) has all we need (Has all we need)
Sky of blue (Sky of blue) and sea of green (Sea of green)
In our yellow (In our yellow) submarine (Submarine, ha, ha)

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

_SOT Only A Northern Song _EOT

If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that

When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there

And I told you there's no one there

The more I learn, the less I know

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow

Something in the things she shows me

_SOT Maxwell's Silver Hammer _EOT

Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so" oh oh oh
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Do do do do do
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P.C. Thirty-One said "We caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Do do do do do
Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Wow wow wow oh!
Do do do do do

Silver hammer Max

In his octopus's garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

And got myself a steady job

Everything's the same

Rain, I don't mind

It's just a state of mind?

Can you hear me, can you hear me?

_SOT Lady Madonna _EOT

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was Heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest?

See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

The less one really knows

Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of Heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing

_SOT The Ballad Of John And Yoko _EOT

Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it OK
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspapers said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Oh boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you
But your soul, think!"

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspapers said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

Caught an early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me

_SOT Old Brown Shoe _EOT

I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours, to miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on across the universe

Deep down in Louisianna
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B.Goode!

Until they sound just like a symphony

She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

Ah, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care (fade out)

_SOT Yesterday _EOT

Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

_SOT Help! _EOT

The next song we'd like to sing...
Shurrup! I'll kill you... is our latest record. Umm yea abop
Or our latest electronic noise
Depending who's side on
Any road, we'd like to carry on with this last number
We'd like thank you all of you, so wonderful. Ha ha!
And it's called, "Help!"
1, 2, 3, 4

Help! I need somebody
Help! Not just anybody
Help! You know I need someone

(When) When I was younger (When I was young) so much younger than today
(I never need) I never needed anybody's help in any way
(Now) But now these days are gone (These days are gone) and I'm not so self assured
(And now I find) Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

(Now) And now my life has changed (My life has changed) in oh so many ways
(My independence) My independence seems to vanish in the haze
(But) But ev'ry now (Every now and then) and then I feel so insecure
(I know that I) I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

When I was younger, so much younger than today

_SOT Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby _EOT

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now

Woke up last night, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby now

Went out last night I didn't stay late
'Fore I got home I had nineteen dates

Everybody's trying to be my baby

Went out last night I didn't stay late

_SOT Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) _EOT

I once had a girl
Or should I say
She once had me

She showed me her room
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird had flown

So I lit a fire
Isn't it good
Norwegian wood

_SOT I'm Looking Through You _EOT

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

I'm looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Yeah
Oh baby I'm changed
Ah I'm looking through you
Yeah I'm looking through you

_SOT Tomorrow Never Knows _EOT

Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing...

... that ignorance and hates may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

So play the game "Existence" to the end...
... Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning

_SOT Got To Get You Into My Life _EOT

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day?

_SOT And Your Bird Can Sing _EOT

You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me, you don't get me

You say you've seen Seven Wonders and your bird is green
But you can't see me, you can't see me

When your prized possessions start to weigh you down
Look in my direction, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me, you can't hear me

_SOT Taxman _EOT

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

If you drive a car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet

Cos I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

Don't ask me what I want it for (Aahh Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more (Aahh Mr. Heath)
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cos I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

And you're working for no one but me

_SOT Eleanor Rigby _EOT

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?

_SOT I'm Only Sleeping _EOT

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

Ooh yeah

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

_SOT Rock And Roll Music _EOT

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

_SOT She's A Woman _EOT

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

She don't give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her
She don't give the boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving, don't ask me why

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me love
Forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

She's a woman, she's a woman
She's a woman, she's a woman

_SOT Strawberry Fields Forever _EOT

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Always, no sometimes, think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a "Yes" but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down, cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

_SOT Penny Lane _EOT

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

_SOT A Day In The Life _EOT

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car;
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy;
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on

_SOT Good Morning, Good Morning _EOT

Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street

After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing is changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

_SOT Only A Northern Song _EOT

If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that

When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there

And I told you there's no one there

_SOT Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite! _EOT

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline

The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair, what a scene!

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate

The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late!

Messrs. K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound

And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill!

_SOT Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds _EOT

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters with looking-glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds [fade out]

_SOT Within You Without You _EOT

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

_SOT The Fool On The Hill _EOT

Day after day, alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was Heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest?

See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on across the universe

Jai guru deva om

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?

Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours, to miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom

And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning

There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain

How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

And I have waited too long

If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.

Because a genuine Hawaii ukulele cost me 30 guineas,
And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.
I'm just an English boy who won a holiday in Waikiki.
Oh yeah, yeah.

Across the coral sands I saw a hula hula dancer, looking pretty.

And my mother is Italian,
And my dad's a Greek."

And even all the grass skirts were PVC.

And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,

_SOT Rainy Day In June _EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

_SOT This Is Where I Belong _EOT
 
I can't think of a place I'd rather be.
The whole wide world doesn't mean so much to me,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Tell me now if you want me to stay.
It don't matter, 'cause I'd stay here anyway.
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Well, I ain't gonna wander,
Like the boy I used to know.
He's a real unluckly fella,
And he's got no place to go.

I won't search for a house upon a hill.
Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
I'll believe all that you put down.
I'll believe the sun is going up,
Even though it's going down.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
Don't you twist my words around.
I'll kill you, I won't let you,
Distort my simple sound.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

_SOT Death Of A Clown _EOT
 
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown

_SOT Two Sisters _EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

_SOT No Return _EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

And her bones might ache and her skin might sag
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag

And she curses herself for the life she's led

Do anything just to get a harry rag
And I curse myself for the life I've led
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Ah, the smart young ladies of the land
Can't relax without a harry in their hand
And they light one and they boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
Do anything just to get a harry rag
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag
So content because they got a harry rag

Harry rag, harry rag
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag

Earned enough to pay the rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied

Johnny gave up his position
Just to please his mother-in-law

He left and turned his back on door[?]

Now he's looking at the situations vacant
Situations vacant
Just to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

And sought a less plush residence
And poor Suzy and Johnny had to skimp and save
Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

And shake my head till there's no more life in me.
It's ruining my brain,
I'll never be the same,
My poor demented mind is slowly going.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

There's too much on my mind.

_SOT Rainy Day In June _EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

So I packed my bags and flew across the sea all on my local paper.
I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.

And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.

And my dad's a Greek."

And even all the grass skirts were PVC.

Looking for her child in the big black smoke,

According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

_SOT Rainy Day In June _EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.

Life is easier now.

Tell me now if you want me to stay.
It don't matter, 'cause I'd stay here anyway.
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Well, I ain't gonna wander,
Like the boy I used to know.
He's a real unluckly fella,
And he's got no place to go.

I won't search for a house upon a hill.
Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.

Distort my simple sound.

Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

Hey, Mr. Reporter,

I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

_SOT Two Sisters _EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

_SOT No Return _EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

So content because they got a harry rag

So to keep his little mama satisfied

Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied

All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

And when you're old and grey you will remember what they said,
That two girls are too many, three's a crowd and four you're dead.

Oh Dandy, Dandy,
When you gonna give up?

_SOT Too Much On My Mind _EOT
 
There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.
I'm thinking all the time,
There's too much on my mind,
It seems there's more to life than just to live it.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,
About it.

My thought just weigh me down,
And drag me to the ground,
And shake my head till there's no more life in me.
It's ruining my brain,
I'll never be the same,
My poor demented mind is slowly going.

There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can say.
There's too much on my mind,
And there is nothing I can do
About it,

_SOT Rainy Day In June _EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

Was not all that it might seem.

According to her Ma, according to her Pa,

Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,

And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

And ran away from home

And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs

And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

_SOT Rainy Day In June _EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

_SOT Big Black Smoke _EOT
 
She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.

How's your sister, how's your brother?
How's your brand, new limousine,
Twenty-four inch TV screen?
Did you like prosperity
More than you liked poverty?
Life is easier, so much easier,
Life is easier now.

Oh Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs Pleasant?
Did you know she was flirting around
With another young man,
And he's taking her out
When you have to work late?
And it's not so pleasant after all, hey hey.

I can't think of a place I'd rather be.

For this is where I belong,

Tell me now if you want me to stay.
It don't matter, 'cause I'd stay here anyway.
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.

Well, I ain't gonna wander,
Like the boy I used to know.
He's a real unluckly fella,
And he's got no place to go.

I won't search for a house upon a hill.
Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.

Distort my simple sound.

Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Hey, Mr. Reporter,
How 'bout talking about yourself?
Do you like what you're doing,
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?
And is that why you run down
All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things
Because they rub you the wrong way.

I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

_SOT Two Sisters _EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

_SOT No Return _EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return

Stars would shine no more
I would walk up and down this lonely room
I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied
He went and bought the weekly classified
All for peace and quiet's sake

Johnny's got no money
Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

If you don't want to come back?

To have a happy home once more.

Rosy won't you please come home?
Two long years have passed away.
Since you tried to change your life,
Christmas wasn't quite the same.

Rosy, Rosy, got any answers?
You are miles across the sea,
And I'll bake a cake if you tell me
You are on the first plane home.

Rosy won't you please come home?
Mama don't know where you've been.

Your room's clean and no one's in it.

You are all the world to me.
Take a look and see if you like it,
If you like it please come back.

Oh Rosy, will you please come back?

_SOT Too Much On My Mind _EOT
 
There's too much on my mind,
There's too much on my mind,
And I can't sleep at night thinking about it.

_SOT Rainy Day In June _EOT
 
A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

I sailed to Hawaii in the U.S.A.

And even when I'm swimming I have to pay.

And my dad's a Greek."

Was not all that it might seem.

Dances sadly on.

Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,

And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

And ran away from home

And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,

Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served

And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Lazy old sun
What have you done to summertime?
Hiding away
Behind all those misty thunder clouds
I don't mind
To spend my time
Looking for you
For you are my one reality
When I'm dead and gone
Your light will shine eternally
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

When I was young
My world was three foot, seven inch tall
When you were young
There was no world at all
Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun
Lazy old sun

A misty shadow spread its wings
And covered all the ground
And even though the sun was out
The rain came pouring down

And all the light had disappeared
And faded in the gloom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

The eagle spread its mighty wings
And pounced upon its pray
And all the skies, so brilliant blue
Turned suddenly to grey

The cherished things are perishing
And buried in their tomb
There is no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

The demon stretched its crinkled hand
And snatched a butterfly
The elves and gnomes were hunched in fear
Too terrified to cry

The reckoning was beckoning
They're living to their doom
There was no hope, no reasoning
This rainy day in June

And everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain
Everybody felt the rain

_SOT Big Black Smoke _EOT
 
She was sick and tired of country life.
A little country home,
A little country folk,
Made her blood run cold.
Now her mother pines her heart away,
Looking for her child in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

Frailest, purest girl the world has seen,
According to her Ma, according to her Pa,
And everybody said,
That she knew no sin and did no wrong,
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke,
Of the big black smoke.

Well, she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys,
And every penny she had
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes.

She took all her pretty coloured clothes,
And ran away from home
And the boy next door,
For a boy named Joe.
And he took her money for the rent
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke,
In the big black smoke.

In the big black smoke.
In the big black smoke.

For this is where I belong,

Well, I ain't gonna wander,

Why should I when I'd only miss you still,
For this is where I belong,
This is where I belong.
This is where I belong.

Did your daddy stop you playing
With your friends when you were young?

All the young folks have their fun. [?]

The reason I am stupid,
Is because I read you every day.
You misquote all of the true things

The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown

Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

_SOT Two Sisters _EOT
 
Sylvilla looked into her mirror
Percilla looked into the washing machine
And the drudgery of being wed
She was so jealous of her sister
And her liberty, and her smart young friends
She was so jealous of her sister

Sylvilla looked into the wardrobe
Percilla looked into the frying pan
And the bacon and eggs
And the breakfast is served
She was so jealous of her sister
And her way of life, and her luxury flat
She was so jealous of her sister

She threw away her dirty dishes just to be free again
Her women's weekly magazines just to be free again
And put the children in the nursery just to be free again
Percilla saw her little children
And then decided she was better off
Than the wayward lass that her sister had been
No longer jealous of her sister
So she ran 'round the house with her curlers on
No longer jealous of her sister

_SOT No Return _EOT
 
If, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell

Stars would shine no more

I would have friends, but be alone
For there is no return

For you were my first love
And now it looks like you've gone
And I have waited too long

For if, if I could see
Just how lonely my life would be
If you passed me by and said farewell
And there is no return
There is no return

Just to help to pay the weekly rent

So to keep his little mama satisfied

All for peace and quiet's sake

Got no where to go
Johnny's in a great big hole
Suzy's separated, living with her ma
Now little mama's satisfied

Sunny rain, shine my way
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun

Far from all the soot and noise of the city,
There's a village green.
It's been a long time
Since I last set eyes on the church with the steeple
Down by the village green.
'Twas there I met a girl called Daisy
And kissed her by the old oak tree.
Although I loved my Daisy, I saw fame,
And so I left the village green.

I miss the village green,
And all the simple people.
I miss the village green,
The church, the clock, the steeple.
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.

And now all the houses
Are rare antiquities.
American tourists flock to see the village green.
They snap their photographs and say "Gawd darn it,
Isn't it a pretty scene?"
And Daisy's married Tom the grocer boy,
And now he owns a grocery.

I miss the village green,
And all the simple people.
I miss the village green,
The church, the clock, the steeple.
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.

And I will return there,
And I'll and Daisy,
And we'll sip tea, laugh,
And talk about the village green.
We will laugh and talk about the village green.

'Cause you're starstruck, baby, starstruck.
Taken in by the lights,
Think you'll never look back,
You know you're starstruck on me.

Baby, you're running around like you're crazy.
You go to a party and dance through the night,
And you'll drink 'till you're tight,
And then you're out on your feet.

'Cause you're starstruck, baby, starstruck.
Taken in by the lights,
Think you'll never look back,
You know you're starstruck on me.

Baby, watch out or else you'll be ruined,
'Cause once you're addicted to wine and champagne,
It's gonna drive you insane,
Because the world's not so tame.

And you're starstruck, baby, starstruck.
You're taken in by the lights,
Think you'll never look back,
You know you're starstruck on me.
Don't you know that you are,
Starstruck on me.
And you always will be,
Starstruck on me.
Starstruck on me.

_SOT Phenomenal Cat _EOT
 
A long, long time ago,
In the land of idiot boys,
There live a cat, a phenomenal cat,
Who loved to wallow all day.

No one bothered him
As he sat, content in his tree.
He just lived to eat 'cause it kept him fat,
And that's how he wanted to stay.

Though he was big and fat,
All the world was good to him,
And he pointed out on the map
All the places he had been.
[Cowes, Cathage,Karthom,Cannes?], [India,Sardinia?], Kathmandu,
The Scilley Isles and Sahara, too

Fum, fum, diddle-um di
La la la la, la-la la la
La la la la, la-la la la la
La la la la-la la la

Once when he was thin
He had flown to old Hong Kong,
And had learned the secret of life,
And the sea and the sky beyond.
So he gave up his diet and sat in a tree,
And ate himself through eternity.

Fum, fum, diddle-um di
La la la la la-la la la
La la la la, la-la la la la
La la la la-la la la
Fum, fum, diddle-um di
Fum, fum, diddle-um di

_SOT All Of My Friends Were There _EOT
 
My big day, it was the biggest day of my life.
It was the summit of my long career,
But I felt so down, and I drank too much beer,
The management said that I shouldn't appear.
I walked out onto the stage and started to speak.
The first night I've missed for a couple of years,
I explained to the crowed and they started to jeer,
And just when I wanted no one to be there,
All of my friends were there.
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.
All of my friends were there to stand and stare,
Say what they may, all of their friends need not stay.
Those who laughed were not friends anyway.
All of my friends were there to stand and stare.

Days went by, I walked around dressed in a disguise.
I wore a mustache and I parted my hair,
And gave the impression that I did not care,
But oh, the embarrassment, oh, the dispair.
Came the day, helped with a few large glasses of gin,
I nervously mounted the stage once again,
Got through my performance and no one complained,
Thank God I can go back to normal again.
I went to that old cafe,
Where I had been in much happier days,
And all of my friends were there,
And no one cared.
Say what they may, all of my friends were there.
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.
All of my friends were there,
Now I don't care.

_SOT Wicked Annabella _EOT
 
In a dark and misty house,
Where no Christian man has been,
Wicked Annabella mixes a brew
That no one's ever seen.

Relatives have passed her by,
Too scared to even say hello.
She's in perpetual midnight,
She shuts out the day,
And goes about her sinful ways.

I, I've seen her hair, I've seen her face,
Look towards mine.
I, I've felt her eyes burning my sole,
Twisting my mind.

Little children who are good
Should always go to sleep at night,
'Cause Wicked Annabella is up in the sky
Hopin' they will open their eyes.

Don't go into woods tonight,
'Cause underneath the sticks and stones
Are lots of little demons enslaved by Annabella
Waiting just to carry you home

Just in case someone thought they had missed it,
And to proved that it really existed.
Fathers take pictures of the mothers,
And the sisters take pictures of brothers,
Just to show that they love one another.

You can't picture love that you took from me,
When we were young and the world was free.
Pictures of things as they used to be,
Don't show me no more, please.

People take pictures of each other,
Just to prove that they really existed,

People take pictures of each other,
And the moment to last them for ever,
Of the time when they mattered to someone.

Someone has killed some mother's son today
Head blown up by some soldier's gun
While all the mothers stand and wait
Some mother's son ain't coming home today
Some mothers son ain't got no grave

Two soldiers fighting in a trench
One soldier glances up to see the sun
And dreams of games he played when he was young
And then his friend calls out his name
It stops his dream and as he turns his head
A second later he is dead

Some mother's son lies in a field
Back home they put his picture in a frame
But all dead soldiers look the same
While all the parents stand and wait
To meet their children coming home from school
Some mother's son is lying dead

Somewhere someone is crying
Someone is trying to be so brave
But still the world keeps turning
Though all the children have gone away

Some mother's son lies in a field
But in his mother's eyes he looks the same
As on the day he went away

They put his picture on the wall
They put flowers in the picture frame
Some mothers memory remains

Your picture's hanging loose on a rusting nail.

And this man, he weeps tonight,
And his head is bowed with sorrow,
But what can you do, sitting there,
And you let him cry tomorrow,
Yes, you'll let him cry tomorrow.
Yes, you'll let him cry tomorrow.

And this man, he weeps tonight,
And his head is bowed with sorrow,

Yes, you'll let him cry tomorrow.

Hey, Mr. Green Grocer's daughter,
Hey, Mr. Green Grocer's daughter,
Don't turn your head away.
Don't take the sun away.

Every time I see you I wanna say "hey".

But I'm coming home, gonna make you mine.

Hey, Mr. Cake Baker's daughter,

Every time I see you I wanna say "hey".
But every time you see me you walking away from me.
I've been gone for such a long, long time,
But I'm coming home, gonna make you mine.

How is that fresh morning feeling?
How is the dawn and the evening?
I will be free today.

_SOT The Contenders _EOT
 
Hush little mammy don't you cry
I've got to see what it's like on the world outside
Got to get out of this life somehow
Got to be free, got to be free now

I don't want to be a constructor of highways
A sweeper of sidewalks, I've got to do it my way
I'm too ill-equipped for a mathematician
A shrewd politician, a maker of decisions

We're not the greatest when when we're separated
But when we're together I think we're going to make it
I don't want to be like a fascist dictator
A saint or a sinner, I want to be a winner

_SOT Strangers _EOT
 
Where are you going I don't mind
I've killed my world and I've killed my time
So where do I go what do I see
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Till peace we find tell you what I'll do
All the things I own I will share with you
If I feel tomorrow like I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'Cos soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

_SOT Denmark Street _EOT
 
Down the way from the Tottenham Court Road
Just round the corner from old Soho
There's a place where the publishers go
If you don't know which way to go
Just open your ears and follow your nose
'Cos the street is shakin' from the tapping of toes
You can hear that music play anytime on any day
Every rhythm, every way
You got to a publisher and play him your song
He says 'I hate your music and you hair is too long
But I'll sign you up because I'd hate to be wrong'
You've got a tune it's in your head you want to get it placed
So you take it up to a music man just to see what he will say
He says 'I hate the tune, I hate the words but I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll sign you up and take it round the street and see if it makes the grade'
And you might even hear it played on the rock 'n' roll hit parade
Daytime, night time, every week you can hear that heavy beat
Now the walls are shaking from the tapping of feet
Daytime, night time, every day you can hear that music play
Every rhythm, every way

_SOT Get Back In Line _EOT
 
Facing the world ain't easy when there isn't anything going
Standing at the corner waiting watching time go by
Will I go to work today or shall I bide my time
'Cos when I see that union man walking down the street
He's the man who decides if I live or I die, if I starve, or I eat
Then he walks up to me and the sun begins to shine
Then he walks right past and I know that I've got to get back in the line
Now I think of what my mamma told me
She always said that it would never ever work out
But all I want to do is make some money
And bring you home some wine
For I don't ever want you to see me
Standing in that line
'Cause that union man's got such a hold over me
He's the man who decides if I live or I die, if I starve, or I eat
Then he walks up to me and the sun begins to shine
Then he walks right past and I know that I've got to get back in the line

_SOT Lola _EOT
 
I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola [LP version - Coca-Cola:]
C O L A cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L O L A Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walk like a woman but talk like a man
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said little boy won't you come home with me
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me

Well that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Well I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said little boy I'm gonna make you a man

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

_SOT Top Of The Pops _EOT
 
I've just come in at Number 25
I'm oh so happy, so glad to be alive
And everybody says it's going to get to the top
Life is so easy when your record's hot.
Go tell my mamma and my sister too
To press my trousers and polish my shoes
I might even end up a rock-and-roll god
It might turn into a steady job.
And my agent said to me: "Son, I always told you so."
Now my record's number 11 on the BBC
But number seven on the N.M.E.
Not the Melody Maker want to interview me
And ask my view on politics and theories on religion.
Now my record's up to number 3
And a woman recognized me and started to scream
This all seems like a crazy dream
I've been invited to a dinner with a prominent queen
And now I've got friends that I never knew I had before.
It's strange how people want you when you record's high
'Cos when it drops down they just pass you by
Now my agent just called me and said it me:
"Son your record's just got to Number One."

_SOT The Moneygoround _EOT
 
Robert owes half to Grenville
Who in turn gave half to Larry
Who adored my instrumentals
And so he gave half to a foreign publisher
She took half the money that was earned in some far distant land
Gave back half to Larry and I end up with half of goodness knows what
Oh can somebody explain why things go on this way
I thought they were my friends I can't believe it's me, I can't believe that I'm so green
Eyes down round and round let's all sit and watch the moneygoround
Everyone take a little bit here and a little bit there
Do they all deserve money from a song that they've never heard
They don't know the tune and they don't know the words
But they don't give a damn
There's no end to it I'm in a pit and I'm stuck in it
The money goes round and around and around
And it comes out here when they've all taken their share
I went to see a solicitor and my story was heard and the writs were served
On the verge of a nervous breakdown I decided to fight right to the end
But if I ever get my money I'll be too old and grey to spend it
Oh, but life goes on and on and no one ever wins
And time goes quickly by just like the moneygoround
I only hope that I'll survive

_SOT This Time Tomorrow _EOT
 
This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere, sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow what will we know
Will we still be here, watching an in-flight movie show
I'll leave the sun behind me and I'll watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
Seven miles below me I can see the world and it ain't so big at all
Well, this time tomorrow what will we see
Fields full of houses, endless rows of crowded streets
I don't know where I'm going, I don't want to see
I feel the world below me looking up at me

Leave the sun behind me, and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
And I'm in perpetual motion and the world below doesn't matter much to me
Well, this time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere, sailing across any empty sea
Well, this time tomorrow where will we be
This time tomorrow what will we see
This time tomorrow

_SOT A Long Way From Home _EOT
 
You've come a long way from the runny-nosed and scruffy kid I knew
You had such good ways
I can remember the little things that always made you smile
They made you happy
Now you think you're wiser because you're older and you think
That money buys everything
And you think you need no one to guide you
But you're still a long way from home.
You've come a long way, you're self-assured and dressed in
Funny clothes, but you don't know me.
I hope you find what you are looking for with your car and handmade overcoats
But your wealth will never make you stronger 'cos you're still a
Long way from home
Yes, you're still a long way from home

_SOT Rats _EOT
 
I was lost just wandering round downtown
Many people pushing me around
Hate spreads just like infection
Those rats jumping on and off my back
Fat black rats holding me down
I see rats in every direction
No time to catch your breath
Crazy people lost their heads
Masses trampling on my feet, inconsiderate in their heat
Those rats breeding angriness and spite
Never have done anything right for people like you and me
Walk over all the people you can't see
If they die there's more bread for me
Like snakes crawling through the grass
No time to catch your breath
Crazy people lost their heads
Masses trampling on my feet, inconsiderate in their heat
Those rats breeding angriness and spite
Never have done anything right for people like you and me
See that face man look at me, he's much too selfish to see
Once he was warm and was kind
Now all he has got is a pinstripe mind
See that face man look at me, he's much too selfish to see
Once he was warm and was kind
Now all he has got is a pinstripe mind

_SOT Apeman _EOT
 
I think I'm sophisticated
'Cos I'm living my life like a good homosapien
But all around me everybody's multiplying
Till they're walking round like flies man
So I'm no better than the animals sitting in their cages
In the zoo man
'Cos compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees
I am an ape man
I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized
'Cos I'm a strict vegetarian
But with the over-population and inflation and starvation
And the crazy politicians
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an ape man
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man I'm a King Kong man I'm ape ape man
I'm an ape man
'Cos compared to the sun that sits in the sky
Compared to the clouds as they roll by
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies
I am an ape man
In man's evolution he has created the cities and
The motor traffic rumble, but give me half a chance
And I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle
'Cos the only time that I feel at ease
Is swinging up and down in a coconut tree
Oh what a life of luxury to be like an ape man
I'm an ape, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man
I'm an ape man
I look out my window, but I can't see the sky
'Cos the air pollution is fogging up my eyes
I want to get out of this city alive
And make like an ape man
Come and love me, be my ape man girl
And we will be so happy in my ape man world
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man
I'm an ape man
I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane
And we'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day
Just like an ape man
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voo-doo man
I'm an ape man.
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore
And make like an ape man.

I know a man, he's a powerful man
He's got the people in his power
In the palm of his hand.
He started at the bottom and he worked his way up
Now he's never going to stop
Until he reaches the top.
It's the same old story, it's the same old dream,
It's power man, power man, and all that it can bring.
If you want your money, you better stand in the line
'Cos you'll only end up picking up nickels and dimes.
You call him names and he sits and grins
'Cos everybody else is just a sucker to him.
And he's got my money, but I've got my faith
And powerman, powerman, I'll never be your slave.
It's the same old story, it's the same old game
It's power man, power man, driving me insane
People tried to conquer the world Napoleon and Genghis Khan
Hitler tried and Mussolini too
Powerman don't need to fight, powerman don't need no guns
Powerman got money on his side
Well I'm not rich and I'm not free
But I've got my girl and she got me
He's got my money and my publishing rights
But I've got my girl and I'm alright
And she got me going, and she keeps me sane
But powerman, powerman, got money on the brain
It's the same old story it's the same old game
Powerman, powerman driving me insane

Got to be free to laugh when I want
Think what I want and cry if I like

He's got no right at all
'Cause we are all God's children

Oh, we gotta go back the way the good lord made us all

Don't want this world to change me

Same lungs that he gave me to breath with
Same eyes he gave me to see with

Oh, the rich man, the poor man, the saint and the sinner
The wise man, the simpleton, the loser and the winner
We are all the same to Him
Stripped of our clothes and all the things we own
The day that we are born
We are all God's children
And they got no right to change us
Oh, we gotta go back the way the good lord made

I know a place not far away
And we'll find a way through the city streets
We'll find a way through the mad rushing crowd
And we'll talk about the way love used to be

Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry
And I ain't gonna let this big world get me down
I gotta learn to keep a hold of my head and keep my feet on the ground
Moments of ecstatic happiness
And the moments of stress that we had better forget
But love, I gotta feeling that I've said it all before
I said it before
I say I'll never do you wrong but then I go and do the same again
I don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why, don't know why
We gotta learn to share these moments in our lives
And never let it get us down, we gotta put up a fight
Moments to remember all our lives

A mechanical nightmare,
The wonderful world of technology,
Napalm, hydrogen bombs, biological warfare,

This is the twentieth century,
But too much aggravation
It's the age of insanity,
What has become of the green pleasant fields of Jerusalem.

Ain't got no ambition, I'm just disillusioned
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.
My mama said she can't understand me
She can't see my motivation
Just give me some security,
I'm a paranoid schizoid product of the twentieth century.

You keep all your smart modern writers
Give me William Shakespeare
You keep all your smart modern painters
I'll take Rembrandt, Titian, Da Vinci and Gainsborough,

Girl we gotta get out of here
We gotta find a solution
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't want to die here.

I was born in a welfare state
Ruled by bureaucracy
Controlled by civil servants
And people dressed in grey
Got no privacy, got no liberty
Cos the twentieth century people
Took it all away from me.

Don't wanna get myself shot down
By some trigger happy policeman,
Gotta keep a hold on my sanity
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna die here.

My mama says she can't understand me
She can't see my motivation
Ain't got no security,
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.

This is the twentieth century
But too much aggravation
This is the edge of insanity
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.

They're demonstrating outside I think they're gonna start the third world war,
I've been to my local head shrinker,
To help classify my disease,
He said it's one of the cases of acute schizophrenia he sees.

Well the milkman's a spy, and the grocer keeps on following me,
And the woman next door's an undercover for the K.G.B.,
And the man from the Social Security
Keeps on invading my privacy,
Oh there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease.

I've got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too,
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia,
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose,
Acute schizophrenia blues.

I'm lost on the river, the river of no return,
I can't make decisions, I don't know which way I'm gonna turn,
Even my old dad, lost some of the best friends he ever had,
Apparently, his was a case of acute schizophrenia too.

I got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too,
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia,
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose,

They're watching my house and they're tapping my telephone,
I don't trust nobody, but I'm much too scared to be on my own
And the income tax collector's got his beady eye on me,
No there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease.

No there ain't no cure for

Holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I'm oh so glad they sent me away,
To have a little holiday today, holiday.
Holiday,
And I'm just standing on the end of a pier,
Hoping and dreaming you were here,
To share my little holiday.

Lookin' in the sky for a gap in the clouds,
Sometimes I think that sun ain't never coming out,
But I'd rather be here than in that dirty old town,
I had to leave the city cos it really brought me down.

Oh holiday, oh what a lovely day today,
I think I'll get down on my little ol' knees and pray, thank you Lord,
Thank heaven for this holiday today, holiday.
I'm leaving insecurity behind me,
The environmental pressures got me down,
I don't need no sedatives to pull me round,
I don't need no sleeping pills to help me sleep sound.

Oh holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I think I'll get down on my little ol' knees and pray,
That's what I'll do,
Thank heaven for this holiday.

Lying on the beach with my back burned rare,
The salt gets in my blisters and the sand gets in my hair,
And the sea's an open sewer,
But I really couldn't care,
I'm breathing through my mouth so I don't have to sniff the air.

Oh holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I'm so glad they sent me away,
To have a little holiday.

And she's given up the alcohol and pizzas
And the pies and now she looks as if she's ready to die,

Don't eat no buttered scones
Don't eat no carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

_SOT Alcohol _EOT
 
Here's a story about a sinner,
He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position,
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements,
And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition,
It turned him to the booze,
And he got mixed up with a floosie
And she led him to a life of indecision.
The floosie made him spend his dole
She left him lying on Skid Row
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission.
It's such a shame.

Oh demon alcohol,
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would say,
Damn it all and blow it all,
Oh demon alcohol,
Memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.

Barley wine, pink gin,
He'll drink anything,
Port, pernod or tequila,
Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks,
As long as all his troubles disappeared.
But he messed up his life, went and beat up his wife,
And the floosie's gone and found another sucker
She's gonna turn him on to drink
She's gonna lead him to the brink
And when his money's gone,
She'll leave him in the gutter,
It's such a shame.

Oh demon alcohol,
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would say,
Damn it all and blow it all,

Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall,
A slave to demon alcohol.

_SOT Complicated Life _EOT
 
Well I woke this morning with a pain in my neck,
A pain in my heart and a pain in my chest,
I went to the doctor and the good doctor said,
You gotta slow down your life or you're gonna be dead,
Cut out the struggle and strife,
It only complicates your life.

Well I cut down women, I cut out booze,
I stopped ironing my shirts, cleaning my shoes,
I stopped going to work, stopped reading the news,
I sit and twiddle my thumbs cos I got nothing to do,
Minimal exercise,
To help uncomplicate my life,
Gotta stand and face it life is so complicated,
Ladi dah di dahdah, ladi dah di dah dah,
You gotta get away from the complicated life, son,
Life is overrated, life is complicated,
Must alleviate this complicated life.

Cut out the struggle and strife,
It's such a complicated life.

Like old Mother Hubbard
I got nothin' in the cupboard,
Got no dinner and I got no supper,
Holes in my shoes, I got holes in my socks,
I can't go to work cos I can't get a job,
The bills are rising sky high,
It's such a complicated life,
Gotta stand and face it,
Life is so complicated.
Ladi dah di dahdah, ladi dah di dah dah
Gotta get away from the complicated life, son,
Life is overrated, life is complicated,
Must alleviate this complicated life.

Gotta get away from the complicated life, son,
Gotta get away from the complicated life.

_SOT Here Come The People In Grey _EOT
 
I got a letter this morning with some serious news that's gone and ruined my day,
The borough surveyor's used compulsory purchase to acquire my domain,
They're gonna pull up the floors, they're gonna knock down the walls,
They're gonna dig up the drains.

Here come the people in grey, they're gonna take me away to Lord knows only where,
But I'm so unprepared, I got no time to pack and I got nothing to wear,
Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Me and my baby gonna get on a train that's gonna take us away,
We're gonna live in a tent, we're gonna pay no more rent, we're gonna pay no more rates,
We're gonna live in a field, we're gonna buy me gun to keep the policemen away.

I'm gonna pass me a brand new resolution,
I'm gonna fight me a one man revolution, someway,
Gonna beat those people in grey,
But here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

People in grey have gone and taken away my right to voice my complaint,
Her Majesty's Government have sent me a form, I must complete it today.
But it's making me blue, don't wanna tell all my secrets to
The people in grey.

Gonna pass me a brand new resolution,
Gonna fight me a one man revolution, someway,
Gonna start my rebellion today.
But here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

Oh, Lord, those people in grey,
I gotta get back at those people in grey,
Here come the people in grey,
To take me away.

_SOT Have A Cuppa Tea _EOT
 
Granny's always ravin' and rantin',
And she's always puffin' and pantin',
And she's always screaming and shouting,
And she's always brewing up tea.

Grandpappy's never late for his dinner,
Cos he loves his leg of beef
And he washes it down with a brandy,
And a fresh made pot of tea.

[Chorus:]
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea.

If you feel a bit under the weather,
If you feel a little bit peeved,
Take granny's stand-by potion
For any old cough or wheeze.
It's a cure for hepatitis, it's a cure for chronic insomnia,
It's a cure for tonsillitis and for water on the knee.

[Chorus]

Tea in the morning, tea in the evening, tea at supper time,
You get tea when it's raining, tea when it's snowing,
Tea when the weather's fine.
You get tea as a mid-day stimulant
You get tea with your afternoon tea
For any old ailment or disease
For Christ sake have a cuppa tea.

[Chorus]

Whatever the situation, whatever the race or creed,
Tea knows no segregation, no class nor pedigree
It knows no motivations, no sect or organisation,
It knows no one religion,
Nor political belief.

[Chorus]

_SOT Holloway Jail _EOT
 
They took my baby to Holloway jail,
They took my baby, down Holloway jail,
She was a lady when she went in,
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.

She was just succeeding in the city,
She was just beginning to excel,
And then a spiv named Frankie Simes
Led her to a life of crime,
And led her on the downward trail.

Frankie came home late from work one evening,
The C.I.D. were hot on his trail,
Frankie promised everything,
And then he went and turned her in,
She went and took the rap for him,
Now she's impaled in Holloway jail.

They took my baby, down Holloway jail,
They took my baby to Holloway jail,
There ain't no pity, there ain't no bail,
And she assures me that it's living hell.

She was young and ever so pretty,
Now she looks so old and pale,
She never sees the day,
She wastes her life away,
Sitting in that prison cell.

They took my baby to Holloway jail,
They locked my baby in Holloway jail,
She was a lady when she went in,
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.

She's impaled, in Holloway jail.

_SOT Oklahoma U.S.A. _EOT
 
All life we work but work is bore,
If life's for livin' what's livin' for,
She lives in a house that's near decay,
Built for the industrial revolution,
But in her dreams she is far away,
In Oklahoma U.S.A.
With Shirley Jones and Gordon McRea,
As she buys her paper at the corner shop,
She's walkin' on the surrey with the fringe on top,
Cos in her dreams she is far away,
In Oklahoma U.S.A.,
She walks to work but she's still in a daze,
She's Rita Hayworth or Doris Day,
And Errol Flynn's gonna take her away,
To Oklahoma U.S.A.,
All life we work but work is a bore,
If life's for livin' then what's livin' for.

_SOT Uncle Son _EOT
 
He was just a workin' man,
Simple rules and simple plans,
Fancy words he didn't understand,
He loved with his heart,
He worked with his hands.

Liberals dream of equal rights,
Conservatives live in a world gone by,
Socialists preach of a promised land,
But old Uncle Son was an ordinary man.

Bless you Uncle Son,
They won't forget you when the revolution comes.

Unionists tell you when to strike,
Generals tell you when to fight,
Preachers teach you wrong from right,
They'll feed you when you're born,
And use you all your life.

Bless you Uncle Son,
They won't forget you when the revolution comes.

_SOT Muswell Hillbilly _EOT
 
Well I said goodbye to Rosie Rooke this morning
I'm gonna miss her bloodshot alcoholic eyes
She wore her Sunday hat so she'd impress me
I'm gonna carry her memory 'til the day I die

They'll move me up to Muswell Hill tomorrow
Photographs and souvenirs are all I've got
They're gonna try and make me change my way of living
But they'll never make me something that I'm not

Cos I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in old West Virginia
Never seen New Orleans, Oklahoma, Tennessee
Still I dream of the Black Hills that I ain't never seen

They're putting us identical little boxes
No character just uniformity
They're trying to build a computerised community
But they'll never make a zombie out of me

They'll try and make me study elocution
Because they say my accent isn't right
They can clear the slums as part of their solution
But they're never gonna kill my cockney pride

Cos I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia
Though my hills, they're not green
I've seen them in my dreams
Take me back to those Black Hills
That I ain't never seen

Well I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia
Though my hills, they're not green
I've seen them in my dreams
Take me back to those Black Hills
That I ain't never seen

_SOT Mountain Woman _EOT
 
They lived together in a dirty old shack
At the edge of the black rocky mountain
And they drank mountain dew and they lived on the food
That they grew at the side of the mountain

She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
They lived all their lives by the valley
She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Uneducated but they're happy

Mountain woman couldn't read nor write
But she knew good from evil, she knew wrong from right
When the government tried to buy her water rights
Her intuition was her only guide

She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Lived all their lives by the valley
She's a mountain woman, he's her mountain man
Uneducated but they're happy
Spend my life with my mountain woman
We're uneducated by we're happy

The civil servant used compulsory purchase
To acquire the valley for the nation
They'll dig up the land, they're gonna make a dam
And build a hydroelectric power station

And now she lives on the 33rd floor
Of a man-made concrete mountain
She got an elevator and refrigerator
And an automobile to run around in

Fast talkin' lawyers from the government
Went and beat proud mountain woman down
Hey mountain woman, take your mountain man
They took your land and flood your valley

Spend my life with my mountain woman
They're uneducated by they're happy

_SOT Kentucky Moon _EOT
 
Never been anywhere south of the Delaware
Never been through Kalamazoo
Never been to Timbuktu

Living is fantasy, traveling mentally
Making up tunes in hotel rooms
'Bout places I've never been to

Though I've never crooned under a Kentucky moon

I had my dream, Kentucky moon
But it's only moon dreams
From songs, films and TV
But I can visualize what I've never seen
But I had my dream, Kentucky moon

Route 66 to me is still a mystery
And Ohio, too
Went Chicago blue down to St. Louie blues

Never been anywhere south of the Delaware
Never been through Kalamazoo
Never been to Timbuktu

But I can visualize what I've never seen
So I sit and dream, Kentucky moon

As I sit by a stream in the moon
But it's just imagery
From songs, films and TV
But I can visualize what I've never seen
So I sit and dream, Kentucky moon

_SOT Here Comes Yet Another Day _EOT
 
Here comes yet another day, creeping through my window.
Drank myself to sleep last night, beer stains on my pillow.
I gotta pull my things together,
The night can last forever.

Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.
Can't stop, can't be late, mustn't make the people wait.
Can't even comb my hair or even change my underwear,
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day,
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.

There goes another night, here comes another flight,
Can't stop gotta go, here comes yet another show.
Gotta pack up my clothes, brush my teeth, blow my nose.

No time to use the John, gotta keep a rollin' on.
Here comes a new day, here comes a new stage,
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.

Made a lot of conversation, talked a lot of weather,
I hope we meet again some day, and spend some time together.
No time for affection,
I'm moving in a new direction.

Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day,
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.
Can't stop, can't be late, mustn't make the people wait.
Can't stop to comb my hair or even change my underwear.
See that morning break, oh Lord, here comes yet another day,

Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.

_SOT Maximum Consumption _EOT
 
I'll have some clam chowder, followed by beef steak on rye
Pumpkin pie, whipped cream and coffee,
I wanna green salad on the side,
Don't forget the french fries,
Pizza pie, garlic and anchovie.
I keep burning up calories as fast as I keep putting them down,
Eat food, put it in my mouth,
Chew it up, swallow it down,
I'll have two eggs, over light, home made apple pie
Cole slaw as a side order.
I gotta stay fit, stay alive, eat food to sustain a non-stop high-grade performer.
The pace is continual, sure keeps running me down
Don't you know that you gotta eat food,
Don't you know that you gotta refuel.
I'm a Maximum Consumption, super-grade performer.
High powered machine,
Go steady on my clutch, go easy on the hills
And you'll get a lot of mileage out of me.
I'm so easy to drive, and I'm an excellent ride,
Excessive living sure keeps running me down
You've got to learn to use the Maximum Juice
That's how you get the maximum use.
Life keeps using me, keeps on abusing me, mentally and physically.
I gotta stay fit, stay alive, need fuel inside, eat food to survive
Maximum Consumption sure keeps running me down
Don't you know that you gotta eat food
Don't you know that it's good for you.
I'm a Maximum Consumption,
Non-stop machine
Total automation perpetual motion.

_SOT Unreal Reality (The Real Thing) _EOT
 
All that I see, seems so unreal to me,
Is it the truth or is it only fantasy,
Is it a dream or is it unreal reality?

All around me is such unreality,
Optical illusions as far as my eyes can see,
Is the whole thing a fake, or the ultimate reality?

That house is so big that it reaches right up to the clouds
It's got hundreds of windows, so the people inside can look out,
And they look down below and wonder what it's all about.

Look at that lady she got silver all over her face,
Is she a human being or a creature from outer space,
Is she authentic or phoney, I guess it's just a matter of taste.

Oh because they can feel it, it's gotta be the real thing,
Because they can touch it, it's gotta be reality.
If they say it's real, it's gotta be the real thing.

See that fella, looking all spick and span,
Is he a tailor's dummy or is he a real man,
Is he genuine, or straight off the assembly line.

All round me is such unreality,
Optical illusions as far as my eyes can see,
Is the whole thing a fake or the ultimate reality?

Is it a dream, or is it the real reality?

_SOT Hot Potatoes _EOT
 
My baby woke me up this mornin'
She said get down that labour exchange,
And if you don't come home with a job son,
You'll get no dinner to-day.

You'll get no more fancy cookin',
You'll get no more apple pie,
You'll just get those plain hot potatoes
To satisfy your appetite.

La la la la la la Potatoes,
Boiled, French fried, any old way that you wanna decide.
Hot potatoes, yeh,

I said I don't need your fancy cooking,
I like the simple things in life,
Just give me those plain hot potatoes
And I'll be well satisfied,
They'll satisfy my appetite.

La la la la la la Potatoes,
Boiled, French fried, any old way that you wanna decide.
Hot potatoes, yeh,
I want your lovin' 60 minutes an hour,
I want your lovin' 24 hours a day,
I want your lovin' 7 days a week.
Yeh, yeh, oh yeh.
I want your love, I need your love,
But all I get is hot potatoes
When I come home late at night
To satisfy my appetite.

Don't give me no more potatoes,
Boiled, French fried, any old way you wanna decide.
Hot potatoes,

_SOT Sitting In My Hotel _EOT
 
If my friends could see me now, driving round just like a film star,
In a chauffeur driven jam jar, they would laugh.
They would all be saying that it's not really me,
They would all be asking who I'm trying to be.
If my friends could see me now,
Looking out my hotel window,
Dressed in satin strides and two-tone daisy roots,
If my friends could see me now I know they would smile.

Sitting in my hotel, hiding from the dramas of this great big world,
Seven stories high, looking at the world go by-y.
Sitting in my hotel room, thinking about the countryside and sunny days in June.
Trying to hide the gloom, sitting in my hotel room.

If my friends could see me now, dressing up in my bow-tie,
Prancing round the room like some outrageous poove,
They would tell me that I'm just being used
They would ask me what I'm trying to prove.
They would see me in my hotel,
Watching late shows till the morning,
Writing songs for old time vaudeville revues.
All my friends would ask me what it's all leading to.

Sitting in my hotel, looking through the window at the people in the street,
Seven stories high looking at the world go by,
Sitting in my hotel, looking at the world outside.

If my friends could see me now they would try to understand me,
They would ask me what on earth I'm trying to prove.
All my friends would ask me what it's all leading to.

Motorway food is the worst in the world,
You've never eaten food like you've eaten on the motorway.
Motorway food is the worst in the world,

And gasoline fumes are the worst to inhale,
Your stomach rolls over and your face turns pale.

Oh, that motorway livin',
Ain't it a thrill to be so free, yeh.
Riding down the motorway,
Got to charge up my batteries,
Rest my seat, rest my eyes,

So tired, tired of livin', tired of livin' this motorway livin'.

Motorway tea is warm and wet,
The rain is a pouring and it's four in the morning,
And it's all I can get.
You've never seen loos like motorway loos,
Thousands of people passing through,
It's enough to put you off of your motorway food.

Oh that motorway living,
Ain't it a thrill to be so free, yeh.
Got to get away from
Cats eyes, cold meat pies,
Thousand on raft, cold French fries
So tired, tired of livin', tired of livin' this motorway livin'.

Motorway food is invariably fried,
It keeps me and feeds me and helps me survive.
Oh that motorway, ain't it a thrill to be so free, yeh,
Riding down the motorway, cats eyes, cold meat pies
Thousand on raft, cold French fries,
So tired, tired of livin', tired of livin' this motorway livin'.

Motorway food is the worst in the world,
You'll never eat food like you've eaten on the motorway.
Motorway food is the worst in the world.

My stomach's upset and I don't feel well,
Gotta get my head down, stop for a while in a motorway hotel.

A bumpy ride to-day

And for a while they'll say your records never make it,
But in a while they're gonna be showering you with praises.
They'll give you mediocre reviews
And put you in the underground for a while,
But look a little on the funny, sunny side of life,
Look a little on the sunny side.

You sing 'em the blues
And then they ask for a happy tune,
And when you start to smile they'll say gimme dat rhythm and blues,
And when you give 'em dat rhythm and blues they'll simply smile and say
We didn't want to hear you play,
We didn't like you any way.
It's very hard to please the people every single time,
But look a little on the sunny side.

Look a little on the sunny side
Even when you feel you want to hide,
You gotta laugh, don't let your critics ever upset you,
'Cos for a while the cynics will all be out to get you.
You gotta be shrewd, you gotta be strong
You've gotta convince yourself that you are not wrong,
Whistle a tune and think of a catchy, happy, little song
And look a little on the sunny side.

It's very hard to please the people every single time,

Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star,
And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are.
There are stars in every city,
In every house and on every street,
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete!

Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard,
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard
But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne,
But she turned her back on stardom,
Because she wanted to be alone.

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard,
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of,
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.
Rudolph Valentino, looks very much alive,
And he looks up ladies' dresses as they sadly pass him by.
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cos he's liable to turn and bite,
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life.
If you covered him with garbage,
George Sanders would still have style,
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn round and smile,
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
'Cos she's not very tough,
She should have been made of iron or steel,
But she was only made of flesh and blood.

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard,
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of.
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.

Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star
And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are.

And those who are successful,
Be always on your guard,
Success walks hand in hand with failure
Along Hollywood Boulevard.

I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show,
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes,
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die.

You can see all the stars as you walk along Hollywood Boulevard,

Life is so easy when your record's hot.
Go tell my mamma and my sister too
To press my trousers and polish my shoes
I might even end up a rock-and-roll god
It might turn into a steady job.
And my agent said to me: "Son, I always told you so."
Now my record's number 11 on the BBC
But number seven on the N.M.E.
Not the Melody Maker want to interview me
And ask my view on politics and theories on religion.
Now my record's up to number 3
And a woman recognized me and started to scream
This all seems like a crazy dream
I've been invited to a dinner with a prominent queen
And now I've got friends that I never knew I had before.
It's strange how people want you when you record's high
'Cos when it drops down they just pass you by
Now my agent just called me and said it me:

All your life they've kicked you around and pushed you around
Till you can't take any more

But you don't want to get up off the floor
Mister you're just brainwashed

Well the milkman's a spy, and the grocer keeps on following me,
And the woman next door's an undercover for the K.G.B.,
And the man from the Social Security
Keeps on invading my privacy,
Oh there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease.

I've got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too,
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia,
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose,
Acute schizophrenia blues.

I'm lost on the river, the river of no return,
I can't make decisions, I don't know which way I'm gonna turn,
Even my old dad, lost some of the best friends he ever had,
Apparently, his was a case of acute schizophrenia too.

I got acute schizophrenia, paranoia too,
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia,
I've got it, you've got it, we can't lose,

They're watching my house and they're tapping my telephone,
I don't trust nobody, but I'm much too scared to be on my own
And the income tax collector's got his beady eye on me,
No there ain't no cure for acute schizophrenia disease.

No there ain't no cure for
Schizophrenia disease.

_SOT Holiday _EOT
 
Holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I'm oh so glad they sent me away,
To have a little holiday today, holiday.
Holiday,
And I'm just standing on the end of a pier,
Hoping and dreaming you were here,
To share my little holiday.

Lookin' in the sky for a gap in the clouds,
Sometimes I think that sun ain't never coming out,
But I'd rather be here than in that dirty old town,
I had to leave the city cos it really brought me down.

Oh holiday, oh what a lovely day today,
I think I'll get down on my little ol' knees and pray, thank you Lord,
Thank heaven for this holiday today, holiday.
I'm leaving insecurity behind me,
The environmental pressures got me down,
I don't need no sedatives to pull me round,
I don't need no sleeping pills to help me sleep sound.

Oh holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I think I'll get down on my little ol' knees and pray,
That's what I'll do,
Thank heaven for this holiday.

Lying on the beach with my back burned rare,
The salt gets in my blisters and the sand gets in my hair,
And the sea's an open sewer,
But I really couldn't care,
I'm breathing through my mouth so I don't have to sniff the air.

Oh holiday,
Oh what a lovely day today,
I'm so glad they sent me away,
To have a little holiday.

_SOT Muswell Hillbilly _EOT
 
Well I said goodbye to Rosie Rooke this morning
I'm gonna miss her bloodshot alcoholic eyes
She wore her Sunday hat so she'd impress me
I'm gonna carry her memory 'til the day I die

They'll move me up to Muswell Hill tomorrow
Photographs and souvenirs are all I've got
They're gonna try and make me change my way of living
But they'll never make me something that I'm not

Cos I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in old West Virginia
Never seen New Orleans, Oklahoma, Tennessee
Still I dream of the Black Hills that I ain't never seen

They're putting us identical little boxes
No character just uniformity
They're trying to build a computerised community
But they'll never make a zombie out of me

They'll try and make me study elocution
Because they say my accent isn't right
They can clear the slums as part of their solution
But they're never gonna kill my cockney pride

Cos I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia
Though my hills, they're not green
I've seen them in my dreams
Take me back to those Black Hills
That I ain't never seen

Well I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia
Though my hills, they're not green
I've seen them in my dreams
Take me back to those Black Hills
That I ain't never seen

_SOT Alcohol _EOT
 
Here's a story about a sinner,
He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position,
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements,
And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition,
It turned him to the booze,
And he got mixed up with a floosie
And she led him to a life of indecision.
The floosie made him spend his dole
She left him lying on Skid Row
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission.
It's such a shame.

Oh demon alcohol,
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would say,
Damn it all and blow it all,
Oh demon alcohol,
Memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.

Barley wine, pink gin,
He'll drink anything,
Port, pernod or tequila,
Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks,
As long as all his troubles disappeared.
But he messed up his life, went and beat up his wife,
And the floosie's gone and found another sucker
She's gonna turn him on to drink
She's gonna lead him to the brink
And when his money's gone,
She'll leave him in the gutter,
It's such a shame.

Oh demon alcohol,
Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would say,
Damn it all and blow it all,

Sad memories I cannot recall,
Who thought I would fall,
A slave to demon alcohol.

_SOT Skin And Bone _EOT
 
Fat Flabby Annie was incredibly big
She weighed just about sixteen stone
And then a fake dietician went and put her on a diet
Now she looks like skin and bone
She looks like skin and bone

Do the meditation and yoga
And she's thrown away the good food guide
And she's given up the alcohol and pizzas
And the pies and now she looks as if she's ready to die,
You can't see her walk by

Don't eat no mashed potatoes,
Don't eat no buttered scones
Stay away from carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

Living on the edge of starvation
And she says she's got no appetite
And her father and her mother
And her sisters and her brothers
Couldn't see her when she walked by
You can't see her walk by.

She don't eat no mashed potatoes,
She don't eat no buttered scones
Stay away from carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

She used to be so cuddly,
She used to be so fat,
But oh what a sin cos she's oh so thin
That she lost all the friends that she had,
She looks like skin and bone

If you look flabby
And you feel overweight,
And you wanna lose a couple of stone,
Take a crash course diet do your daily exercises
And you'll look like skin and bone.

Come on rattle them bones,
Put your hands up to the ceiling,
Bend your hips and touch your toes,
Do your daily exercises,
You're gonna look like skin and bone,

Don't eat no mashed potatoes,
Don't eat no buttered scones
Don't eat no carbohydrates
You're gonna look like skin and bone.

_SOT Baby Face _EOT
 
I never knew why I loved you so much
Maybe it's the way you look at me when you get up in the morning
I didn't need a shove,
I just fell in love,
With your little baby face

Baby face,
You got the prettiest little baby face
There isn't another one to take your place
Baby face
You got my heart a jumpin'
You sure have started something

Baby face,
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace
I didn't need a shove,
I just fell in love
With your pretty little baby face

You got my heart a-jumpin'
You sure have started something

Baby face,
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace
I didn't need a shove,
I just fell in love
With your pretty little baby face,
Pretty little baby face,
Pretty little baby face.

_SOT Lola _EOT
 
I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola [LP version - Coca-Cola:]
C O L A cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L O L A Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walk like a woman but talk like a man
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said little boy won't you come home with me
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me

Well that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Well I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said little boy I'm gonna make you a man

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

_SOT Preservation _EOT
 
Once upon a time
In a faraway land
Lived a villain called Flash
He was such a wicked man
He terrorized the people
He broke arms and crushed hands
He ruled with a fist and he purchased all the land

Then he plowed up the fields and cut down the trees
For property speculation
And he did it all for a pot of gold
And for his own preservation

The people were scared
They didn't know where to turn
They couldn't see any salvation
From the hoods and the spivs
And the crooked politicians
Who were cheating and lying to the nation

Save the fields and the trees
And give them back to the nation
Bring the government down
A new leader must be found
For the sake of preservation

He said he did it to help us all
And did it for the good of the nation
But he did it for a pot of gold
And for his own preservation

When money is evil
And power is corrupt
The devil moves in and takes over
Mr. Flash broke his word
And now he's got to pay
For his crimes and his lies and his evil ways

And it's gonna get rough
And it's gonna get rough
It's a crime and a sin that no one can win
In a story of self preservation

_SOT Daylight _EOT
 
[Sung by Chorus]

Daylight over the Village Green early in the morning.
Daylight over the hills and valleys heralding the morning.
Daylight over the mountains, daylight on the Village Green,
Daylight over the field and the factories.
Another night has gone away and here comes yet another day.

See the early morning risers walking round with bleary eyes.
Worn out housewives grit their teeth ignoring new born babies' cries.
Look at all the busy people this way, that way, everywhere
Biting toast and swallowing tea and breakfast specials on the air.
Feel that daylight.

Feel the sunlight on my pillow and it stops my yawing.
I thank God that I'm still around to see another dawn in.
Daylight over the valleys, daylight lighting up the trees,
Daylight over the hillside,
Smile a smile and sing a song, another night has been and gone.

Middle-aged bankers crack their backs and wish they were young and in their teens,
Lonely spinsters dream of dating Roger Moore or Steve McQueen.
Health fanatics in their attics training for the Empire Games,
School boys dream of Captain Scarlet, battle ships and aeroplanes.

Feel that daylight, Daylight.
Daylight on the Village Green,
Daylight,
Field and the valleys,
Daylight.

_SOT Sweet Lady Genevieve _EOT
 
[Sung by The Tramp]

Once under a scarlet sky I told you never ending lies,
But they were the words of a drunken vagabond
Who knew very well he would break your heart before long
Oh forgive me Genevieve.

Now I've come back to see Sweet Lady Genevieve,
This time I'll give you some security
And I will make promises I can keep
So will you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve.

Let me rock you, hold you,
Take you in my arms.
Forgive me, please,
Smile away all your sadness, put your trust in me.

Oh if you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve,
I'm not the impetuous fool you used to know
I know that I used you and I hurt you so,
But that was so long ago Sweet Lady Genevieve.

Oh, love me,
Take me in your arms.
Let me rock you, hold you,
Smile away all your sadness, put your trust in me.

Once under a starry sky I led you on and told you lies
Drank too much whiskey on that hot summer night.
I acted so slyly because you were acting so shy,
Oh forgive me Genevieve.

If you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve,
You're not the child who smiled so innocently
And I'm not the rogue that I used to be,
So will you come back to me Sweet Lady Genevieve.

Oh Genevieve, Oh Genevieve.

_SOT There's A Change In The Weather _EOT
 
[Sung by Working Class Man, Middle Class Man and Upper Class Man]

I'm just a simple working man
Gettin' by the best I can
In this crazy mixed-up muddled-up world that I live in.

I'm a middle class sort of a guy
I'm not rich but I get by
Pretending that I know just what I'm doin'.

I'm a well bred upper class sort of chap,
I don't care much about this and that
Even when I know there's trouble brewin'.

We think there's a change in the weather
We've got to learn to stick together.
We've seen the thunder clouds in the sky,
I wanna live, I don't wanna die.

I think the weather's changing, I hope the weather is gonna change.
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.
I think there's a change in the weather, I hope good weather is here to stay,
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.

See the holocaust risin' over the horizon,
Gonna see a manifestation, total chaos, devastation,
Anticyclone and tornados brewin',
Gonna feel the lightnin' strikin',
Thunder clap smoke a frightnin',

There's gonna be evil doin',
There's trouble brewin',
Everybody scared,
Too much thunder, too much fightin'.

Heavy storm clouds comin',
Gonna cover up the sun
And gonna terrify everyone,
Better pack up your bags and run.

I think there's a change in the weather, I think the weather is going to change.
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.
I think there's a change in the weather, I hope good weather is here to stay.
I hope it's a change for the better and it will brighten up my day.

_SOT Where Are They Now? _EOT
 
[Sung by The Tramp]

I'll sing a song about some people you might know
They made front pages in the news not long ago
But now they're just part of a crowd
And I wonder where they all are now.

Where have all the Swinging Londoners gone?
Ossie Clark and Mary Quant
And what of Christine Keeler,
John Stephen and Alvaro,
Where on earth did they all go?
Mr. Fish and Mr. Chow,
Yeah, I wonder where they all are now.

Where are all the Teddy Boys now?
Where are all the Teddy Boys now?
The Brill Cream boys with D.A.s,
Drainpipes and blue suedes,
Beatniks with long pullovers on,
And coffee bars and Ban the Bomb,
Yeah, where have all the Teddy Boys gone?
I hope that Arthur Seaton is alright.
I hope that Charlie Bubbles had a very pleasant flight,
And Jimmy Porter's learned to laugh and smile,
And Joe Lampton's learned to live a life of style.

Where are all the angry young men now?
Where are all the angry young men now?
Barstow and Osborne, Waterhouse and Sillitoe,
Where on earth did they all go?
And where are all the protest songs?
Yes, where have all the angry young men gone.

I wonder what became of all the Rockers and the Mods.
I hope they are making it and they've all got stead jobs,
Oh but rock and roll still lives on,
Yeah, rock and roll still lives on.

_SOT One Of The Survivors _EOT
 
[Sung by Johnny Thunder and Chorus]

See Johnny Thunder sitting on his motorbike
Riding along the highway,
Rock and Roll songs from the nineteen-fifties
Buzzing around in his brain.
Johnny Thunder he's one of the original bebop generation
And he's got no time for complicated music or too much sophistication.

He's one of the survivors,
The motorbike riders.
You ought to see Johnny Thunder riding down the highway
One of the rock and roll survivors,
Twelve bars flowing through his brain.
He digs Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and The Belmonts,
And Johnny & The Hurricanes.

He plays Hound Dog, Oh Boy, and Great Balls of Fire
And Boppin' At The High School Hop.
And he's got no time for phonies or posers
'Cos they don't know how to reel and rock.
And he plays Little Egypt and Ooh Poo Pah Doo,
And he plays Poison Ivy and Blue Suede Shoes,
The Hollywood Argyles, Danny & The Juniors,
Dion & The Belmonts, Johnny & The Hurricanes.

He's one of the survivors,
The boppers and the jivers,
Yeah and he rocks all day.
Johnny & The Hurricanes, Johnny & The Hurricanes.

Got my freedom riding along the freeway.
I ride a hundred miles an hour but I don't mess up my D.A.
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.
You can't stop rock 'n' rollin' music play.
([Repeat] last two lines)

Feel those vibrations flow in my brain.
Got my freedom riding down the highway,
Keeps me sane, feel alive,
I'm one of the survivors.

Feel all right.
First gear, second gear, third gear, fourth gear, all right.
Old Johnny Thunder looks a little overweight,
And his sideburns are turning grey.
But he still likes to bebop, boogie and jive
To his worn out seventy-eights.
Johnny Thunder.
He's alright.
He's one of the survivors,
Twelve bars flowing through his brain,
Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion & The Belmonts,
Johnny & The Hurricanes, Johnny & The Hurricanes.

_SOT Cricket _EOT
 
[Sung by The Vicar]

Some people say that life is a game, well if this is so
I'd like to know the rules on which this game of life is based.
I know of no game more fitting than the age old game of cricket
It has honour, it has character and it's British.
Now God laid down the rules of life when he wrote those Ten Commandments
And to cricket those ten same rules shall apply.
Show compassion and self-righteousness and be honest above all
And come to God's call with bat and ball.

Now the Devil has a player and he's called the Demon Bowler,
He's shrewd, he's rude and he's wicked.
He is sent by Sinful Satan and he's out to take your wicket
And you know that that's not cricket.
He'll baffle you with googlies with leg breaks and offspin
But keep a level head and don't let that demon in.
So keep a straight bat at all times, let the Bible be your guide
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.

All through your life he'll try to bowl you out
Beware the Demon bowler.
He's crafty and deceitful and he'll try to L.B.W.,
And bowl a maiden over.
The Devil takes the weak in spirit and so we must always be courageous
And remember that God is on your side.
So keep old Satan in your sights and play the straight and narrow line
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.

_SOT Money & Corruption / I Am Your Man _EOT
 
We are sick and tired
Of being promised this and that.
We work all day, we sweat and slave
To keep the wealthy fat.
They fill our heads with promises
And bamboozle us with facts,
Then they put on false sincerity
Then they laugh behind our backs.

[Chorus:]
Money and Corruption
Are ruining the land
Crooked politicians
Betray the working man,
Pocketing the profits
And treating us like sheep,
And we're tired of hearing promises
That we know they'll never keep.

[Chorus]

Promises, promises, all we get are promises.
Show us a man who'll understand us, guide us and lead us.

We are sick and tired
Of having to ask them cap in hand
We crawl on the floor
We beg for more,
But still we are ignored.
We're tired of being herded
Like a mindless flock of sheep
And we're tired of hearing promises
That we know they'll never keep.

[Chorus]

We've got to stand together
Every woman, every man,
Because money and corruption are ruining the land.
Show us a man who'll be our Saviour and will lead us.
Show us a man who'll understand us, guide us and lead us.
Show us a man.
Workers of the nation unite.
Workers of the nation unite.

I visualise a day when people will be free
And we'll be living in a new society.
No class distinction, no slums or poverty
I have a vision of a new society.
And every home will have a stereo and TV,
A deep freeze, quadrasonic and a washing machine.
So workers of the nation unite.

I am your man
I'll work out a five-year plan
So vote for me brothers
And I will save this land
And we will nationalise the wealthy companies
And all the directors will be answerable to me,
There'll be no shirking of responsibilities
So people of the nation unite.

Union Man I'll work with you hand in hand
For we're all brothers to our Union Man.
I am your man,
Oh God how I love this land,
So join together save the Fatherland.

I visualize a day when people will be free
And we'll be living in a new society.
No class distinction, no slums or poverty,
So workers of the nation unite,
Workers of the nation unite,
People of the nation unite.

You must obey his every whim,
Or else he's going to do you in.

Then he's gonna screw you just like that.
He is going to use you, his heavies will abuse you,
And then he's gonna lean on you,
Here comes Flash.

He is gonna rough you up,
Duff you up and touch you up,
And then he's gonna screw you up.
Even though he's mean on you,
There's nothing else that you can do
Just sit back and take his abuse.
He will smile at you, be so sweet to you.
Then he's gonna cheat on you.

You'd better run, you'd better fly.
Hide your daughters, hide your wives.
Lock your doors and stay inside.
Here comes Flash.

Once we loved and trusted him,
Now his thugs and bullies make us live in sin.
They suppress us, oppress us, molest us, possess us.

You'd better run, you'd better fly.
Hide your daughters, hide your wives.
And lock your doors and stay inside.

He will smile at you, be a friend to you,
Then he's gonna screw you just like that.

You'd better run, you'd better fly.
Hide your daughters, hide your wives.

_SOT Sitting In The Midday Sun _EOT
 
[Sung by The Tramp]

I'm sitting by the side of a river
Underneath the pale blue sky
I've got no need to worry, I'm in no hurry
I'm looking at the world go by.

Just sitting in the midday sun,
Just soaking up that currant bun,
With no particular purpose or reason
Sitting in the midday sun.

Everybody say I'm lazy
They all tell me get a job you slob,
I'd rather be a hobo walking round with nothing
Than a rich man scared of losing all he's got.

So I'm just sitting in the midday sun
Just soaking up that currant bun,
Why should I have to give my reasons
For sitting in the midday sun

Oh look at all the ladies
Looking their best in their summer dresses,
Oh sitting in the sun.
I've got no home,
I've got no money
But who needs a job when it's sunny.  Wah Wah.

I haven't got a steady occupation
And I can't afford a telephone.
I haven't got a stereo, radio or video
A mortgage, overdraft, a bank loan.

The only way that I can get my fun
Is by sitting in the midday sun
With no particular purpose or reason
Sitting in the midday sun.

Oh listen to the people,
Say I'm a failure and I've got nothing,
Ah but if they would only see
I've got my pride,
I've got no money,
But who needs a job when it's sunny.  Wah Wah.

Everybody thinks I'm crazy,
And everybody says I'm dumb,
But when I see the people shouting at each other
I'd rather be an out of work bum.

So I'm just sitting in the midday sun
Just soaking up that currant bun,
With no particular purpose or reason
Sitting in the midday sun.

_SOT Demolition _EOT
 
[Sung by Flash and his Cronies in their Den]

I spy with my little eye
Anything here that I can buy.
I see a little thatched cottage
Looking so neat
With compulsory purchase we can buy it up cheap.
Then we'll pull up the floor boards,
Knock down the walls,
Rock the foundations,
Until the house falls.
Like a pack of cards,
Crashing to the ground.
Then we'll build a row
Of identical boxes
And sell them all off at treble the profits.
Demolition.

The deeds are in my pocket,
I've got a contract in my hand.
An opportunity for luxury living.
I'll arrange the mortgage
To be repaid a hundred percent.
I can't wait around so make your decision.
We'll buy up all the cottages
And every house and every street,
Until we've got everything we need.
Every town in the vicinity,
Every farm and village green.
We're gonna buy up everything,
Then it's Demolition.
Demolition. Demolition.

Two up, two down,
It hasn't got a garden,
But it's got a lovely patio.
Stainless steel kitchen sink,
Gas fired central heating,
Whaaa - specifically designed for modern-day living,
Nothing's permanent and nothing lasts,
We've sold all the houses so put 'em up fast.
We're gonna buy up this town
And pull it all down.
How I love to hear the demolition sound
Of concrete crashing to the ground.
Demolition.

It's time to make some money,
It's time to get rich quick.
It's the wonderful world of capitalism.
I've got to make a profit,
I've got to satisfy my greed,
It's my faith and my religion,
Demolition. Demolition. Demolition.
And we'll buy up the towns,
And we'll knock 'em all down
Build a brand new world of our own.

_SOT Announcements _EOT
 
"It has been rumored that a new People's Army has been formed by a certain
'Commander Black'.  A few minor incidents have already been reported, and further
Unconfirmed reports suggest that this is a definite attempt to overthrow the
Present government which is led by Mr. Flash.

"We would like to stress that these are only unconfirmed rumors, but we will
Of course bring you up-to-date news and information on these reports as they
Come in.  Meanwhile we do urge the population not to panic and to remain calm
During the crisis."

Please stay tuned to this station for further bulletins.

[Track 5]

[Announcer 1:]
"In just a few moments, Mr. Black is due to address the people.
We are now going over to live coverage of his speech."

[Announcer 2:]
"Well the scenes here are absolutely indescribable.  I've personally
Never seen anything like it before.  A crowd of around, what, thirty-thousand people
Have been waiting all day for the arrival of Mr. Black and his entourage.  And it is
Expected that one of the main topics of his speech this evening will be the controversial
Anti-(something) Corruption Bill, which Mr. Black wants brought into effect immediately
To put an end to the current widespread decline in public moral standards.

"And, just a minute, there he is.  I can see Mr. Black now.  He's surrounded by, of
Course, all his bodyguards.  (something) the crowd is growing wild with excitement -
It's clapping, it's cheering - as Mr. Black finally makes his way on that far side
Onto the platform.  And now - yes, there he is - he's about to speak.

[Track 11]
"News has just reached us of a major victory for Mr. Black and the People's Army.
The battle took place on the outskirts of a small village somewhere in the Northern
Zone.  Casualties on both sides are reported to have been very high, indeed.  And
Our on-the-spot correspondent describes the fighting as some of the fiercest in
Living memory.  No quarter has been shown on either side."

[Track 17]
"At Six A.M. this morning the victorious People's Army overthrew the corrupt regime

_SOT Introduction To Solution _EOT
 
[Sung by The Tramp]

While the rich get their kicks with their affluent antics
Mr. Black sits and ponders their fate.
He just sits in the gloom of his dimly-lit room
Waiting for them to swallow the bait.
While the rich run their rackets he sits in his attic
And casually clocks their defeat.
While the politicians cover up mistakes that they've made
And all the promises, the lies and deceits.
A military coup has been long overdue.
Now there's fighting and panic in the streets.
Amid the mass disillusion, disorder and confusion,
He will rise now his plan is complete.
But me, I'm only standing here
Watching it all go on and I'm watching it all go wrong
And it's painfully clear that the battle is near
And I wish I could just disappear.

While Flash and his men drink champagne in their den
And debase life with crude ostentation,
The poor cry for more, but they're reaching the point
Where the people can't stand any more.
But me, I'm only standing here
Watching it all go on, and I'm watching it all go wrong
And it's painfully clear that the battle is near
And I wish I could just disappear.

_SOT When A Solution Comes _EOT
 
[Sung by Mr. Black in an attic somewhere in suburbia]

When a solution comes,
It's gonna breathe right down on everyone.
When a solution comes
It's gonna cover up the clouds
And eclipse the sun
And black out a pale blue sky,
And everybody's gonna be terrified,
Because they're all going to feel the bite
And there's going to be a revolution
When a solution comes.
It won't take sides with anyone
Regardless of race or creed,
The whole wide world is gonna feel the squeeze.
The red, black, yellow and white
And even the Arabs and the Israelites
They're all going to feel the bite
And there's going to be a revolution.
I've been searching a long, long time,
Looking for a final solution
Searching here, searching there,
Searching everywhere.
Now my day has finally come
It's time to shout to everyone
I have waited a long, long time,
Biding my time and waiting on the sidelines
Watching it all go wrong.
Witnessing the disintegration,
Rubbing my hands in anticipation.
Everybody's searching so desperately,
They've got to run to someone
And that someone's going to be me.
Yeah, I'm gonna change the world,
I'm going to use a little manipulation.
I'm going to build a new civilisation.

_SOT Money Talks _EOT
 
[Scene:]
Into Flash's den - a night club

[Scene:]
In Flash's den, a night club partly converted into an office.

[Sung by Flash, Floosies and Spivs]

Show me a man who says he can live without bread
And I'll show you a man who's a liar and in debt.
There's no one alive who can't be purchased or enticed
There's no man alive who wouldn't sell for a price,
Money talks and we're the living proof,
There ain't no limit to what money can do
Money talks, money talks.

Money can't breathe and money can't see,
But when I pull out a fiver people listen to me.
Money can't run and money can't walk,
But when I write out a cheque I swear to God I hear money talk.
Money talks and, baby, when you've been bought
You pay attention everytime money talks.
Money talks, money talks.

Money talks and there's no doubt about it
Money talks and we can't live without it,
What's the point of living unless you've got money?
I just couldn't function without money.
Money talks, money talks,
Money talks, money talks.

Show me an upright respected man
And I'll have him licking my boots when I put money in his hand.
It rots your heart, it gets to your soul,
Before you know where you are you're a slave to the green gold.
Money talks and we're the living proof
There ain't no limit to what money can do.
Money talks you out of your self-respect,
The more you crave it the cheaper you get.
Money talks, money talks.

Money buys you time and people listen,
Money can buy a smile and make life worth living.
If you're ugly money can improve you.
I just couldn't face the world without mazuma.
Money talks, money talks.

_SOT Shepherds Of The Nation _EOT
 
[Sung by Mr. Black The Do-Gooders]

Down with sex and sin,
Down with pot, heroin.
Down with pornography,
Down with lust.
Down with vice lechery and debauchery.

We are the new centurians.
Shepherds of the Nations.
We'll keep on our guard
For sin and degradation.
We are the national guard
Against filth and depravity,
Perversion and vulgarity,
Homosexuality.
Keep it clean.

Down with nudity,
Breasts that are bare and pubic hair.
We are here to cleanse humanity
From the man in the raincoat's
Pale faced glare.
So sodomites beware.

We are the new centurians,
Shepherds of the Nation.
We'll keep on our guard
For sin and degradation.
We are the national, guard
Against filth and depravity,
Perversion and vulgarity,
Homosexuality.
Keep it clean.

I visualise a day when people will be free
From evils like perversion and pornography.
We'll cast out Satan and we'll set the sinners free,
So people of the nation unite.

Put all the pervs in jail,
Bring back the birch, and the cat of nine tails.
Bring back corporal punishment
Bring back the stocks
And the axeman's block.
Let righteousness prevail.

Down with nudity and hard core magazines.
We'll bring religion back
And keep our country clean.
Keep it clean.

We are the new centurians
Shepherds of the Nation.
We'll keep on our guard
For sin and degradation.
We are the national guard
Against filth and depravity.
Perversion and vulgarity,
Homosexuality.
Keep it clean.

_SOT Scum Of The Earth _EOT
 
[Sung by Flash, Spivs & Floosies.]

[Flash:]
They call me the scum of the earth.
They say I'm the scab of the nation.
But deep inside I'm only human.
Just an ordinary man.
With ordinary plans.
They say I'm crooked and bent,
They call me a rogue and a villain,
But if they could see deep inside me
They'd see a heart that once was pure
Before it touched the evils of this world,
For if I cut myself I bleed
And if I catch a cold I sneeze.
Have I not eyes to help me see?
Have I not lungs to help me breathe?
Have I not hands, organs, senses
And affections just like you?
Stop the music.
Well ain't I human
Like everybody else?
Before you condemn me my friends,
I suggest that you look deep inside you
For good and evil
Exist in all of us,
And no man is a saint
And each creates his heaven and his hell.

[Chorus:]
We know that he's only a man.
He's got feelings and faults
Just like everyone else.

[Flash:]
So don't put me down because I've done well,
For even wide boys, hoods and spivs
Have got the right to live.

[Chorus]:
We know we're the scum of the earth,
We know we're the scab of the nation,
But we're your enemies and your brothers
And no man is a saint
And deep down we're all the same as one another.

_SOT Second-Hand Car Spiv _EOT
 
[Sung by Spiv, Flash & Floosies]

Spiv:   I was born a slum gutter infantile,
Brute-force educated, delinquent juvenile.
I am a product of mass produced factory fodder,
Streets full of tenement blocks, rat infested filth and squalor.
I left school, went straight on the dole
And unemployment's no enjoyment,
Welfare State owned my mind and my body and my soul.
So I worked my way up to be a second-hand car spiv,
But don't judge me harshly because I'm just a slum kid.
I built up my business with a quick wit and fist,
So don't double-cross me or my hoods will dissect you
With their black jacks and shiv.
Slum kids never get a break, they've got to fight their way up.
Wheel and deal, beg and steal,
Sweat blood to earn a buck.
I didn't want to work on the factory floor,
I wasn't content, I wanted more
Than to be a slave of a lathe,
Work all day and go home bored.
So a second- hand car spiv was what I became.
I built an empire because I used my brains.

[Chorus:] He was a second-hand car spiv up from the slums,
So don't judge him harshly because he's just a slum kid.
Then he moved into property, stocks and shares,

Spiv:   And into high finance and you've got to agree
That running a multi-million corporation
Sure beats selling cars second-hand.

[Chorus:] Once he sold old worn out heaps to the punters on the street,

Spiv:   Now I'm in control of the country as a whole,
And the world is at my feet.

[Chorus:] The world is at his feet.

Spiv:   Power, power, I've got power oozing out of me,
And when you think of all the things I've done
It says a lot for one
Who worked his way up from the streets.
Yes I'm a second-hand car spiv.
Do a deal, buy and sell,
It's my trade, I know it well.
Make a sale, ring the bell
And let the suckers go to hell.
Bank the profits, count the change
Another sucker comes your way.
Life is a crooked game,
And slum kids never change.

_SOT He's Evil _EOT
 
[Scene: A party political broadcast - Mr. Black and his followers]

He comes on smooth, cool and kind,
But he wants your body not your mind.
He's got style, personality,
But he's the devil in reality.
He'll make you laugh, make you smile,
And make you feel good for a while.
Wicked smile, decadent grin,
He likes school girls, nuns and virgins.
His skin is soft but his mind is hard,
He'll lead you on then he'll tear you apart.
He'll treat you rough and he will make you cry,
And you will kiss sweet innocence good-bye.
And once you're in there'll be no getting out,
So look out, look out, look out, look out.
He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil.
He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil.

He's got wit he's got charm.
But when he gets rough he'll break your arm.
He's got taste, manners and grace,
But when he gets tough he'll slit your face.
He'll buy you jewels, expensive clothes,
Then his mind'll go and he'll bust your nose.
He's a joker and a clown
But he'll pervert you and drag you down.
He comes on smooth, cool and kind,
But he wants your body not your mind,
He is just the devil in disguise.
He will drag you down and he will make you cry,
And once you're in there will be no getting out.
So look out, look out, look out.
Look out, look out, look out.
He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil.
He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil. He's evil.

_SOT Nobody Gives _EOT
 
[Sung by The Tramp]

I can't understand why everybody's quarreling,
Nobody gives in case they lose face,
And everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent,
And the fact of it is nobody gives any more.

It's the same throughout all history,
Nobody gives unless they receive,
And nobody trusts or is willing to believe
And nobody gives or is willing to concede.

Back in nineteen hundred and twenty-five
There were thousands of people struggling to survive.
There was hunger, unemployment and poverty,
Then in 1926 they decided to be free
So they all went on strike and
The workers told the unions, who blamed it on the government,
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants,
Everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent,
But the fact of it is nobody gives any more.

Back in nineteen hundred and thirty-nine
There were scores of German military waiting in a line,
And the Fatherland wanted what the world wouldn't give,
And then Hitler decided he could take what was his,
So they all went to war and said
Kill all the left-wing intellectuals,
Annihilate the Jews and wipe out their race,
Eliminate the weak because they're ineffectual,
And the fact of it is nobody gives any more.

I'm only sitting here watching it all go on
And listening to both sides.
Yeah, why can't we talk it out,
Why can't we sort it out,
We'll work it out if we try.
Why can't we sit down and work out a compromise,
Why not negotiate and try to be civilised?
I'll tell you why, because nobody gives a damn.
Nobody listens and no one will understand.
Yet I'm wondering, sitting here wondering,
And listening to both sides.
Why can't we work it out?
Why can't we sort it out?
We'll work it out if we try.
Why can't we sit down and work out a compromise,
Why not negotiate and try to be civilised?
I'll tell you why, because nobody gives a damn.
Nobody listens and no one will understand.
Yet, I'm wondering, sitting here wondering,
Yet I'm wondering, sitting here wondering
Listening to both sides.
Nobody gives, nobody gives, nobody gives.

The workers told the unions who blamed it on the government,
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants,
Everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent.

Nobody gives. Nobody gives a damn any more.
The politicians, unions, workers and the militants,
The fact of it is nobody gives any more.

_SOT Oh Where Oh Where Is Love? _EOT
 
[Sung by: The Tramp and the Do-Gooders]

In a world full of jive,
Full of homicide and suicide,
There's no room for love and romance.
In a world full of spite
Full of hatefulness and bitterness,
Sincerity don't stand a chance.
And every night I close my eyes
And ask the stars above,
Oh where, oh where, oh where, oh where is love?

Where is love and romance,
And appreciation of storybooks, fairytales
And the ordinary things people did long ago.
Where did it go?
Where is love?
Where is hope?
Where is sympathy and trust?
Where is faith?
Where is joy in simplicity?
And where is regard and respect?
Oh where, oh where is love?
This world is spinning and turning
And my head is full of learning,
But my thoughts keep on returning
To the things I used to know.
I should be stronger,
But my mind continually wanders
And deep inside
A voice keeps crying
Where, oh where is love?

Where is love and romance,
And appreciation of storybooks, fairytales,
And the ordinary things people did long ago?
Where did it go?
In a world full of jive,
Full of homicide and suicide,
There's no room for love and romance.
In a world full of rape,
Full of hatefulness and bitterness,
Sincerity don't stand a chance.
And every night I close my eyes
And ask the stars above,
Oh where, oh where, oh where, oh where is love?
Where oh where is love?
Where is Love?
Where is hope?
Where is sympathy and trust?
Where is faith?
Where is joy and simplicity
And where is regard and respect?
Oh where, oh where is love?
Oh where oh where is love?
Oh where oh where is love?

After a long day's campaigning Flash, having overindulged
The alcohol, has fallen asleep in his den.

[Voice:]  Cooee. Cooee. Flash. Flash

[Flash:]  Who is this?

[Voice:]  Wake up Flash.  Can you hear me Flash?

[Flash:]  Who is this?  Who dares to wake me from my slumber?

[Voice:]  Need I announce myself?  Am I such a stranger to you?

[Flash:]  Say your name.  Speak!

[Voice:]  I am your soul.

[Flash:]  My soul?

[Voice:]  I have come to show you who you are.

[Flash:]  Show me who I am?  I know who I am you upstart!  How
Dare you intrude.

[Voice:]  You lied and schemed and took over a simple village and
Turned it into a vulgar playground for your own money-
Making ends. Before you came people lived simple lives.
This was a happy place. Then you ploughed up the fields,
Sold off the land and lined your own pockets with the profits.

[Flash:]  Lies!  Lies!  I did it to help the nation

[Voice:]  You did it for your own preservation!

[Flash:]  No!  No!

[Voice:]  Prepare yourself Flash, there are many who suffered at your
Hands. They are craving for vengeance. Time is running out.

[Flash:]  Can this be the end?  Can this be the swan song?  The final
Elbow?  I will not go. The people need me.

[Voice:]  Men like you will always come and go, but the people will go
On forever.  Take one final look at the past Flash.  Enjoy it,
Because you have no future.

[Flash:]  No!  No!  No!  I can't stand this.

Trumpets herald the final confrontation between Flash and himself.

_SOT Flash's Confession _EOT
 
I've just had a dream that I never will forget.
And I wish I could erase.
I was standing on the street with a whole crowd of people
And no one knew my name.
And I was just another face
No one looked at me or touched me
Spoke to or acknowledged me.
I had no identity or individuality
No thoughts of my own, no mind or personality.
I was just a no one, a total nonentity
I'm just a number waiting to be called.
It is time for confessing it all,
I'm just another face,
Yes, it's time for confessing it all.

Been a cheat, been a crook,
Never gave I always took.
Crushed people to acquire
Anything that I desired.
Been deceitful and a liar
Now I'm facing Hell Fire.
I can't believe that my time has come
For confessing all the evil
And the wrong that I've done.
The reckoning's come
And now I'm just a no one.
I confess to the timid and the meek
To the cripples and the beggars
And the tramps in the street.
I confess my cruelty, my ego and conceit.
I've opened up my body and looked inside
And I'm everything that I once despised.
I confess for the thieves,
The affected and deranged,
I confess for the muggers and incurably insane.
I confess to the ugly for being vain,
I confess to those I hurt for causing them pain.
I'm just a number
Waiting to be called
And it's time for confessing it all,
And I'm just another face,
And it is time for confessing it all,
Yes, it's time for confessing it all,
Yes, it's time for confessing it all.

When we were young and green
We shared our dreams together,
And you were my friend.

[Belle:]
We had our good times pal,
We thought they'd last forever.
But nothing lasts forever,
Nothing lasts forever.
Time goes by and people change
It's best we go our separate ways
And it was wrong to think our love would never end
My friend
Nothing lasts forever,
Nothing lasts forever.
Time goes by it takes us all,
Nations crumble and empires fall
And who are we
To think that we would always be,
You see nothing lasts forever,
Nothing lasts forever.

[Flash:]
I know that you'll survive
And you'll get by whatever.
Though you say goodbye.
My love will never die,
It will last forever.

Your love will die but mine will last forever,
Your love will fade but mine will last forever.
Your feeling might go but mine will last forever.
And though you're gone you're in my mind forever.

Full of artificial people.
Cure all diseases, conquer pain
And monitor the human brain,
And see what thoughts you're thinking.
Observe your feelings,
Secret fears,
Controlling everything you say and do
And we will build a master race
To live within our artificial world.
Tell it to the people all across the land,
We're going to build an artificial man
With the physique of a Tarzan
And the profile of a Cary Grant,
A superior being
Totally made by hand.
Throw out imperfection,
Mould you section by section,
Gonna make you the ultimate creation.

[Flash:]    I can visualise the day
When the world will be controlled by artificial people,
But I don't want to live a lie in an artificial world.

[Mr. Black:] Tell the world that we finally did it,
Made a man that's totally programmed,
Preconditioned thoughts and emotions,

Push-button artificial man.
Did you ever want to live forever?
Well here's your chance to be a total automaton
'Cos we've improved on God's creation
An outdated homo sapien.
Make you taller if you want it
Make your hair grow longer if you need it.
If it doesn't exist then I guess we can breed it.
There'll be no disagreements,
We'll dedicate our lives to achievements,
And organise your life and keep it totally planned.

[Flash:]    I can visualise the day
When the world will be controlled by artificial people,
But I don't want to live a lie in an artificial world.

[Mr Black]  Tell the world we finally did it.

Under constant observation
Even when you're dreaming.
Replaced your nose, heart and lungs,
So shake me with your artificial hand.
We went and built a master race
To live within our artificial world.

They say they're outdated and they're obsolete,
And now they're coming to take me away
To Scrapheap City.

There's no quality
And there ain't no style
Just miles and miles
Of Scrapheap piles.
There's no quality
And there's no purity.
They're digging up all of the flowers
Because they look pretty
And erecting identical concrete monstrosities.
They're killing off all of the animals too,
The only ones left are the ones in the zoo.
Now they're coming to take me away
To Scrapheap City.

Swallowed my pride,
Changed my ways,
And found a new religion.

Sick and tired of living on loans,
Driving around in a car that I don't own.
Tired of looking at wealthy faces
Flying off to far out places.

And we will live our lives as equals.

Goodbye youth, goodbye dreams,
The good times and the friends I used to know.
Goodbye freedom, hello fear,

Got to be hard,
Don't look back
And no more reminiscing.
Times are rough,
We've got to be tough,
And concentrate on living.
There you go.

And we'll all join hands,
And we'll all march along
And we'll all mark time as we go.

When you don't know what it's like
To be dragged up from the gutter,
From the wrong side of the tracks.

Why do rich kids get all the breaks,
While the poor slum kids have to work, sweat, struggle and slave?
Why, Lord, there's so much injustice in this world?
Slum kids never stand a chance.

Look at all the slum kids all around you,
Oh, they never stood a chance.
We were dragged up from the gutter,
From the wrong side of the tracks.

_SOT Everybody's A Star (Starmaker) _EOT
 
I am a creator,
Inventor and innovator.
I observe the people,
The ordinary people
No matter what your occupation is
Everybody's in showbiz.
'Cos I'm a Star (gonna make you a star),
And I can make you a Star (gonna make you a star),
I believe that everybody's a celebrity,
And we've all got personality
And individuality.
We all read lines,
And we all act a part,
We all need a script
And an audience to play to.
No matter what you do,
Or who you are,
Everybody's a star.

I'm the magic maker,
I'm the image maker,
I'm the interior decorator.

I can take any man
I see standing in the road
And put rouge on his cheeks
And put some powder on his nose.
I'll teach him how to act,
I'll remould and reshape him.
I'll put him in a stage suit
And I'll teach him how to pose.
I can turn the most ordinary man in the world into a star.
I'm a starmaker (gonna make you a star),
Yes, I'm gonna make you a star (gonna make you a star)
No matter how dull or simple you are
Everybody's a star.

I'm the magic maker,
I'm the image maker,
I can make or break you.
L'm a star maker (gonna make you a star)
Yes, I'm gonna make you a star (gonna make you a star),
Gonna make you a star,
'Cos everybody's a star.

_SOT Ordinary People _EOT
 
[Star:]
I am the image maker.  I am the magic
Maker. I can turn the most ordinary
Man in the world into a star.  To prove
My point I am going to find the most
Mundane little man and turn him into
Celebrity.  Hmm!  This looks like a
Suitably uninteresting house.  I wonder
If there's anybody here with enough
Star quality?

He presses the doorbell.

[Star:]
Hello.  What's your name?

[Wife:]
Andrea.

[Star:]
Oh, that's a nice name. What's your
Husband's name?

[Wife:]
Norman.

[Star:]
His name's Norman.  That sounds
Ordinary enough.  I would like you to
Join in a unique experiment with me.
I am going to take Norman's place for
A few days.  I 'm going to research his
Ordinary dull little existence.

[Wife:]
Oh you can't come in now!  The place
Is in a terrible mess!

[Star:]
That doesn't matter.  I want you to act
Normally.  I want you to treat me as if I
Were Norman.  I am going to sacrifice
My normal flamboyant life style and
Become ordinary, boring little Norman
For a few days.

Ordinary People

It's like another world, being here with you,
It's quite a trip for me, so this is reality.
I'm studying every movement, I'm trying to learn the part,
Now I want you to be natural, just relax and be as you are,
'Cos it's all for art, I want to observe the ordinary people

Tomorrow I shall become Norman,
I shall go to his office,
Mix with his workmates.
And if they ask any questions
I shall say I'm doing research for one of my songs.
Nomand and I are changing places
And I'm going to make him a star,
So I'm throwing away my stage suit and I'm packing away my guitar,
For the sake of art I'm gonna mix with the ordinary people.

[Star:]
God these pyjamas are awful!

[Wife:]
Awful?  Well all I can say is my Norman wears them every night.

[Star:]
Alright, no sacrifice is too great for art!

The things I've done for music,
The things I've done for art.
So I'll make these sacrifices and I'll take it like a star
For the sake of art I will mix with the ordinary people.

[Star:]
You'd better come to bed darling.

[Wife:]
Coming!  You'll never get up for work in the morning.

I'm making observations, and character simulations.
I'll mix with his friends and relations,
And he'll be a part of me.

[Chorus]
He's changing places with Norman,
To get background for his songs.

I'm immortalising his life
And I'll even sleep with his wife,
For the sake of art I'll go to bed like the ordinary people.

Turn out the light.
Turn out the light.

The Star exchanges his silver stage
Suit for Norman's pin stripe suit,
Umbrella and briefcase.  He forsakes
His customary brandy and cigars and
Settles for a cup of hot chocolate before
Going to bed.

[Live version:]
Hey Norman, you're stayin' at home with your wife
And you dream you're a rock-n-roll star
But you've reached the point of no return
And you don't know who you really are
You're livin' in a fantasy world
You don't know what's real
How does it feel, all of your life
In an enchanted lie[?] [could be "eternal lie"?]

[Or possibly it's "Imitating lives of... the ordinary people"]

The ordinary people
The ordinary people
The ordinary people

Hey mister can you lend me a hand
Can you tell me who I really am
Am I just an ordinary guy
Or do I play in a rock-n-roll band
Are you all in my imagination
Are they only in my mind
'Cause I just don't know what to feel
When everything seems real

With the ordinary people
The ordinary people
The ordinary people

_SOT Rush Hour Blues _EOT
 
He gets up early about seven o'clock,
The alarm goes off and then the house starts to rock.
In and out of the bathroom by seven-o-three,
By seven-ten he's downstairs drinking his tea.
So put a shine on your shoes,
Put on your pin-striped suit.
Can't lose those early-morning-can't-stop-yawning,
Push and shoving rush hour blues.

[Wife:]
Darling are you ready?
You'll be late for the bus!

[Star:]
Don't rush me baby
While I'm using my brush.

[Wife:]
Get a move on darling
You're cutting it fine.

[Star:]
Cool it baby
I've got plenty of time.

So put a shine on your shoes
Put on your pin-striped suit.
Can't lose those early-morning-can't-stop-yawning
Push and shoving rush hour blues.

Soon I'll be just one of the commuters
Waiting for the subway train.
I'll be rushing up the stairs
And in the elevator.
By the time that I get there
I'm gonna feel like a mole in the ground
I'll be caught in the crush
I'll be pushed and be shoved,
And I'll be trying to get the subway train.
I'll be fighting with my brief case
And my umbrella,
Every morning and every night.
Some people do it every day of their lives.

[Wife:]
Read the paper later
You'll be caught in the queues.

[Star:]
Don't rush me baby
While I'm reading the news.

[Wife:]
Darling get a move on
You're cutting it fine.

[Star:]
Cool it baby
I've got plenty of time.

A quick cup of coffee and a slice of
Toast and the Star (or should we say,
Norman?) is off to do battle with the
Rush hour queues and traffic jams.

In the rush hour queues
No one gives a damn.
No one knows where I'm going to
No one knows who I am.

I'm sitting in my office
In the metropolis
I'm just part of the scenery,
I'm just part of the machinery.
Chained to my desk on the 22nd floor,
I can't break out through the automatic door,
I'd jump out the window but I can't face the drop
I'm sitting in a cage with an eye on the clock.

I'm ready to start paying my dues,
I've got to lose those early-morning-can't-stop-yawning,
Push and shoving, rush hour blues.

Well I'm ready to start paying my dues,
I've got to lose those early-morning can't-stop-yawning,
Push and shoving rush hour blues.

_SOT Nine To Five _EOT
 
The Star is in Norman's office.  His day
Of sweat and toil has begun.

Nine To Five

Answering phones and dictating letters
Making decisions that affect no one.
Stuck in the office from nine until five
Life is so incredibly dull,
Working from nine to five.

Oh nine to five, nine to five,
Working from nine to five.

And time goes by
The hours tick away.
First seconds,
Then minutes,
Then hours into days.
Each day,
Each week,
Seems just like any other.
All work,
No play,
It's just another day.

He's caught in a mass of computerised trivia,
Deciphering data for mechanical minds.
He's lost in the paperwork and up to his eyes,
He's checking a list that's been checked out before
And he's starting to lose his mind.

Oh nine to five, nine to five,
Working from nine to five.

Worrying won't make it better.

_SOT Underneath The Neon Sign _EOT
 
Our hero leaves the pub his head still
Swimming with alcohol, his head
Buzzing with facts, figures and
Computers.  Night is descending as he
Wearily makes his way home through
The traffic jams and neon lights of the
Great metropolis.

Underneath The Neon Sign

All I see is imitation
And there's no earth beneath my feet.
There are no trees or fields in front of me
Only slabs of concrete.
Skyscrapers reaching up to the clouds,
Don't give the moon a chance to shine,
And I've got imitation moonlight
Standing underneath the neon sign.

Is it real or just illusion?
Can there be day-time when it's night?
Is it merely my delusion
Or are my senses telling me lies.
Is it just hallucination?
Have I been drinking too much wine?
I don't know if it's day or night,
When I'm underneath the neon sign.
Underneath the neon sign.

Electronic nature made by man with robots in mind.
Big city lights guide my way into the night, darkness shines
When I'm standing underneath the neon sign.

If there isn't any sunshine
We'll sunbathe by the neon sign
And if we can't see any stars at night
We'll sit and watch the traffic lights.
If there isn't any day-time
I've got an imitation dawn,
I've got a simulated sunshine
Standing underneath the neon sign.

Is it only an illusion?
Have I been drinking too much wine?
Can there be day-time when it's night
Underneath the neon sign.
Underneath the neon sign.
Is it mother nature
Playing tricks with my eyes
For darkness shines
When I'm standing underneath the neon sign.

_SOT Holiday Romance _EOT
 
On the subway train he sees adverts
For holidays in Jamaica, a weekend in
Rome, a cruise round the
Mediterranean, and dreams of a quiet
Week in a little seaside resort away
From his wife, the ducks on the wall,
The soap operas, the office and his
Friends - and who knows, he might
Encounter a holiday romance.

Holiday Romance

I had a break for a week
So I booked my seat
And confirmed a reservation
At a quiet little seaside hotel.
I packed my bags
And I caught my train and
Reached my destination
Just in time for the dinner gong-ding dong.
Then I saw Lavinia
Standing at the bottom of the stairs.
And I fell for Lavinia
The moment that I saw her standing there.

Lavinia looked so divine
As she walked up to the table to dine
And then Lavinia's eyes met mine.

I thought can this be love,
Can this be lovey-dove
Or just a holiday romance?
Can this be long lost love at last
Or is it just a flash in the pan?

Then after cheese and liqueurs they struck up the band,
I plucked up my courage and I asked Lavinia to dance
That was the start of my holiday romance.
Just a holiday romance.

We did the foxtrot, samba and danced through the night
The last waltz came and we held each other so tight.
That was the start of my holiday romance.

Just a holiday romance
A simple holiday romance.
I wonder should I take a chance?

We walked on the beach,
And we paddled our feet,
And we watched all the swimmers,
And my holiday treat felt complete.
We drank lemonade,
And we sat in the shade,
I thought I must be on a winner
And I acted cool and discreet.
For I knew that Lavinia
Was the shyest lady that I'd ever met,
And I knew that Lavinia
Would only be my lady for the week.

It was just a holiday romance
A simple holiday romance.
I wonder should I take this chance?
Just a holiday romance.

Can this be love,
Can this be lovey-dove
Or just a holiday romance?

I tried to kiss her, she walked away,
She said "Better stop, my husband's
Coming to collect me today".
That was the end of my holiday,
Sweet and innocent holiday,
End of my holiday romance.

_SOT You Make It All Worthwhile _EOT
 
He arrives home. He fumbles in his
Pockets for his keys but there is no
Need.  Andrea is waiting to greet him
With open arms.

[Wife:]
Hello love.  You look all worn out!
Let me take your brief case.  That's a
Good boy.  Now you come and sit down
Ouer here and relax and I'll make you
A nice cuppa tea.  Then we'll have
Dinner and we can sit and watch the
Tele.  By the way dear, how'd you get
On at the office.

You Make It All Worthwhile

I mustn't stay in this job too long
I gotta get out before the hold is too strong
Gotta get out before my ambition is gone
'Cos it's breaking me up and bringing me down.

But when I get home you make it all worthwhile,
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day sorting out the files
You make it all worthwhile.

[Wife:]
Oh, I've just remembered we've only got shepherd's pie,
Do you like it?

[Star:]
No, I hate it.

[Wife:]
Hate it?  But you see Norman loves it so much and you did ask me to
Act normally, didn't you.  I mean I can't cope with all that
Fancy stuff you like to eat.

[Star:]
Alright, I'll eat it and afterwards, I'll write a whole verse about
Your cooking.

You mustn't blame yourself like you do,
It's gonna make a nervous wreck out of you,
So wipe your nose and dry your eyes,
What's the point of cracking up all because of shepherd's pie?

Baby, you never know what I've been through.
I break my back and sweat and slave
To bring some money home to you.
Baby, you won't believe it but it's true
What a boring occupation can do,
It can make a nervous wreck out of you,
It can kill your spirit and destroy your mind.

But when I get home you make it all worthwhile.
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day sorting out the files
You make it all worthwhile.

[Wife:]
Would you like steam pudding and custard for afters.

[Star:]
Darling, that would be marvellous.

And when I come home you make it all worthwhile.
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day working on the files
You make it all worthwhile

[Star:]
Come on darling, let's go and have dinner.

And when I come home you make it all worthwhile.
You make me laugh and you make me smile
And after a hard day working on the files
You make it all worthwhile.

_SOT Ducks On The Wall _EOT
 
After dinner Norman becomes depressed.

[Star:]
Norman's office got on my nerves to-day.

[Wife:]
What do you mean?  You are Norman!

[Star:]
(Shouts) I am a star!

[Wife:]
You're not a star Norman.  You're
Just a plain ordinary little bloke and
Even if you walked down the street in
A silver suit people still wouldn't
Recognise you.  You're dull, ordinary
And uninteresting!  You're a drag!

Star rises from his chair and smashes
The dinner plates to the floor.

[Star:]
I hate this house and I hate you, but
More than anything else I hate those
Ducks!

[Wife:]
Don't you touch those ducks Norman!
They were a present from my mother.
Look, Norman, I've had enough of you
And your ridiculous fantasies.  First of
All you wanted to be a painter, then
You wanted to be an astronaut, then
A footballer and now you're playing at
Being a rock singer.  If you touch those
Ducks I'm leaving!

Ducks On The Wall

My baby's got the most deplorable taste,
But her biggest mistake
Is hanging over the fireplace.
She's got ducks, ducks on the wall,
Ducks, ducks, hanging on the wall.

My lady's got a sort of strange fascination,
An obsessive fixation
For cheap decorations
She's got ducks, ducks on the wall.
Ducks, ducks, hanging on the wall.

Wo-wo-wo I love her so but if she doesn't move the ducks,
I think my mind is gonna go.
Ducks ducks on the wall.
Ducks ducks, hanging on the wall.

I leave the office and I want to relax.
Don't want to stare at a wall
And look at a duck that can't quack.
I love you baby but I can't fall
For those ducks on the wall.

I start to snuggle up and squeeze her so tight.
Then out of the corner of my eye
I see those ducks in flight.
I love you baby but I can't ball
When I see those ducks on the wall.

Wo-wo-wo I can sit through your gossip and your soap opera shows,
But those ducks have got to go.
I love you baby but I can't ball
When I see those ducks on the wall.
And when I went to a cocktail party
With the bores next door,
What was the first thing that I saw?
Ducks, ducks on the wall.
Ducks, ducks hanging on the wall.

My baby's got the most deplorable taste,
But her biggest mistake
Is hanging over the fireplace.
She's got ducks, ducks on the wall,
Ducks, ducks hanging on the wall.

I'll sit and look at all the soap operas with her
I'll play all the panel games and watch all the quiz shows,
But those ducks they've got to go,
Those ducks are getting up my nose.

If those ducks can fly, well so can I.
And if those ducks have got to stay
Then I'm going to fly away.
I love you baby but I can't ball
When I see those ducks on the wall.

Ducks, ducks, ducks on the wall.
Ducks, ducks, ducks on the wall.
Oh those ducks on the wall are beginning to move
They're talking to me
I've got to get away from those ducks.

_SOT (A) Face In The Crowd _EOT
 
Our Star doesn't know who he is any
More.  Is he the starmaker, the image
Maker, looking for material or is he
Just plain boring little Norman after
All?  Perhaps he should accept that he
Is a plain ordinary bloke and not try to
Be something he is not.

(A) Face In The Crowd

I've got to stop faking it,
I've got to start facing it,
I'm going to take my final bow
Then I'm going to take my place in the crowd.
I know I'll get used to it,
I've got to stop acting like a clown.

I've gotta start facing up to what I really am.
I've got to realise l'm just an ordinary man.
I think that I'll just settle down
And take my place in the crowd.
I don't want to lie to myself any more.

Am I just a face in the crowd, is that all I'll ever be?
Don't want to be anything that isn't really me.
Mister, can you tell me who I am?
Do you think I stand out
Or am I just a face in the crowd?

_SOT You Can't Stop The Music _EOT
 
And so Norman decides to stop living
Out his fantasy of being a rock star and
Accept reality.  This is the end for
Norman but not for us because there
Will always be someone ready to take
His place - after all, euerybody's a
Star!

You Can't Stop The Music

Let's all raise a glass
To the rock stars of the past,
Those that made it,
Those that faded,
Those that never even made the grade,
Those that we thought would never last.

Singers come and go,
And stars fade away.
They vanish in the haze
And they're never seen again,
But the music just keeps playing on.

They can't stop the music,
They can't stop the music,
They can't stop the music playing on.

I've been half a million places,
I've seen half a million people who stare,
I've been a star and down and out,
I've been put on, sat on, punched and spat on,
They've called me a faggot, a spiv and a fake,
They can knock me down and tread on my face,
They can't stop the music playing on.

Let's all raise a glass

_SOT Schooldays _EOT
 
If ever you think about the happiest days of your life
Cast back your mind for a while
And remember the time when you were a child.
Don't think of things that make you sad,
Just remember all the good times that you had.

Do you remember only happy days,
Full of flaming Junes and summer holidays?
Or do you remember those stormy Novembers
As we walked in the wind and the rain?
Schooldays were such happy days
Now they seem so far away,
I remember and I'll always treasure.
Schooldays were the happiest days of your life
But we never appreciate the good times we have
Until it's too late.

I miss all the acquaintances we made
And I'd go back if I could only find a way,
Schooldays were the happiest days
Though at the time they filled me with dismay.
We only remember what we choose to remember.
When I was a schoolboy I loathed regulations and rules
I hated my textbooks and my school uniform,
'Cos it made me conform,
And teachers were always disobeyed,
But I'd go back if I could only find a way.

Schooldays were the happiest days,
Now they seem so far away.
I remember and I'll always treasure
Schooldays were the happiest days of your life
But we never appreciate the good times we have

And I'd go back if I could only find a way.

Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.
He walks like his feet are on back to front,

When he waddles down the street he looks kind of queer,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce,
'Cos he's got two left feet and taxi-door ears,

And we all put him down 'cos he can't think fast,

We ridicule him and punch him around,
But Jack just laughs and stands his ground,
The Idiot Dunce, the Idiot Dunce.

Yeah, he's so uncoordinated.
Whoa, and so disorientated,
And when we have a High School Hop
You ought to see that idiot bop
And his arms and his legs
Seem to have minds of their own,
And you don't need brains
To have educated muscles and bones.

Yeah, you ought to see him dance
He moves like he's in a trance,
And when we have a High School Hop
You ought to see that idiot rock,
And he's finally proved
That you don't need a high I.Q.
To make your body move.
Now he's created a dance that everybody's trying to do.
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.

Do the Idiot Dunce.
All right put your finger on your nose,
Now cross those eyes.
Put your hands on your hips,
Now wriggle your backside.
Yes, we got you dancing
To the Idiot Jack
From your head to the tips of your toes.

Now the whole world's doing it and everybody knows,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.
He's a real cool cat and a real gone groove,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.

And the girls go crazy when he starts to move,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce
Now Jack's a success he's got nothing to prove,
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce.

Even though Jack is dim
His mother is so proud of him.
Hey, who's that groovy looking dude
Dancing with all the chicks?
The Idiot Dunce, the Idiot Dunce.

_SOT Education _EOT
 
In a deep dark jungle, long time ago
Lived a lonesome caveman
He was a solitary soul
And he spent his playtime
Chewing meat from bones.
He didn't know how to talk much
He only knew how to groan
Then he lifted up his hands and reached to the sky
Let out a yell and no one replied.
Frustration and torment tore him inside
Then he fell to the ground and he cried and he cried.
But then education saved the day.
He learned to speak and communicate
Education saved the day.
He thanked God for the friends he made.
'Cos everybody needs an education
Everybody needs an education.
Black skin, red skin, yellow or white,
Everybody needs to read and write
Everybody needs an education.

Thank the day when that primitive man
Learned to talk with his brothers
And live off the land.
He left his cave and he moved far away
And he lived with his friends in a house that they'd made
He learned to think and to work with his brain
And he astounded his friends with all the knowledge he gained

He wrote it down on a rock that he found
And he showed all his friends and they passed it around
And then education came that day.
The day it came was a sacred day.
Education came that day
He thanked God for the friends he'd made.

Well man built a boat and he learned how to sail
And he traveled far and wide
Then he looked up above saw the stars in the sky
So he learned how to fly.
And the inventors with their high I.Q.s
And the professors in their colleges
Trying to feed me knowledge
That I know I'll never use.
Thank you sir for the millions of words
That you've handed me down and you've told me to learn

But I've got words in my ears and my eyes
I've got so many facts that I must memorize
Because education's doing me in
I want to stop but my head's in a swim
Education drives me insane
I can't recall all the facts on my brain.
Education came that day
The day it came was a sacred day
Education saved the day
He thanked God for all the friends he made.

Teacher, teach me how to read and write,
You can teach me about biology,
But you can't tell me what I am living for
'Cos that's still a mystery.
Teacher, teach me about nuclear physics
And teach me about the structure of man,
But all your endless calculations
Can't tell me why I am.
No you can't tell me why I am,
No you can't tell me why I am.

Everybody needs education,
Open Universities, education.
Every race, every creed, education.
And every little half-breed.
Every nationality, education.
All the little people need education.
Eskimos and pygmies need
And even aborigines, education.

Well, physics and geography, education.
Philosophy and history, education.
Science and biology, education,
Geometry and poetry, education.
Well, education, education, education, education

[Repeat 'education' till end]

_SOT The First Time We Fall In Love _EOT
 
How well I remember my very first love affair.
Those juvenile fantasies and innocent dreams we shared.
But we're too blind to realize that we are totally unprepared
For the first time we fall in love.
We think it's forever, the first time we fall in love.
We always treasure the first time we fall in love.
Those other romances come and go,
But we cherish the memory of
The first time we fall in love.

First love can be such a strain.
It can rule your head, it can bring you pain,
And when it ends it seems such a shame.
The first time we fall in love,
Can make you sad, it can keep you awake,
It can drive you mad.
People say you're too young and it's only a fad
The first time we fall in love.
The first time we fall in love.

The first time I fell out of love, it knocked me through the floor.
My world came crashing down, it shook me to the core.
I was unprepared 'cos I was only a kid
And I was much too young and I wasn't equipped
For the emotional pressures and stresses of it.
But oh, I'll never forget
The way that she looked the first time we met.
Time goes by but we never forget
The first time we fall in love.

Love can be exciting, it can be a bloody bore.
Love can be a pleasure or nothing but a chore.
Love can be like a dull routine,
It can run you around until you're out of steam.
It can treat you well, it can treat you mean,
Love can mess you around,
Love can pick you up, it can bring you down.
But they'll never know
The feelings we show
The first time we fall in love.
The first time we fall in love.

_SOT I'm In Disgrace _EOT
 
The first time that I saw you
You were the lady of my dreams.
The very next time I had to make you mine,
And I treated you like a queen.
The third time that I saw you
You treated me with such distaste,
Now I wish I'd never seen your face.
I'm in disgrace,
I'm in disgrace.
Because I fell for your pretty face,
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
You captured me in your embrace.

There's no use blaming me
And saying I was your ruination
'Cos it was you equally
That got us into this situation.
It wasn't lust, it wasn't rape,
It was just a mistake
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
Because I fell for your pretty face.
I'm in disgrace.  She's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
You captured me in your embrace.

Was your love real or faked?
Or was it only infatuation?
Picture you in my place.
I wish I'd acted with a little less haste.
I'm in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.
Because I fell for your pretty face.
Oh what a waste.  He's in disgrace.
I'm in disgrace.  He's in disgrace.
Now my name's dirt and I'm disgraced.
I'm in disgrace.

_SOT Headmaster _EOT
 
Headmaster, this is my confession.
This time you won't be overjoyed,
I have destroyed what little faith you had in me,
I've been such a naughty boy.
Headmaster I am at your mercy,
I've been such a little fool.
I've dishonored one who trusted me,
I have broken all the rules.
I've been with those naughty little girls again,
Now those naughty little girls are going to put me to shame.

I wish that I'd been born with a little more sense,
This time it's a serious offense.
I feel like an innocent victim,
I feel that I just can't win.
Headmaster please give me one chance,
Please help me to act like a man.
I've let down the school,
I've broken all the rules,
I've let down the side,
I've committed a crime.

Headmaster, this is my confession,
I've been such a little fool.
I've dishonored one who trusted me,
I have broken all the rules.
I've been such a little fool.
Don't tell all my friends I bent over,
Don't tell them you made me cry.
Don't tell them I've been sacrificed,
Don't tell all my friends or I'll die.
Headmaster don't beat me I beg you,
I know that I've let you down.
Headmaster please spare me I beg you,
Don't make me take my trousers down.

_SOT The Hard Way _EOT
 
Boys like you were born to waste,
You never listen to a word I say
And if you think you're here to mess around,
You're making a big mistake,
'Cos you're gonna find out the hard way,
You gonna find out the hard way.

No matter what I do or say,
You're much too dumb to educate.
One day life's going to turn around and slap you in the face,
Then you're gonna find out the hard way.
You'll take the hard way,
Gonna take the hard way.

Well, you'll do it your way and I'll do it my way,
And we'll see who's the one to survive.
You'll find that with no foundation
Or qualifications
There's no way that you can get by,
No, there's no way you can get by.

Why don't you take the easy way?
Why don't you co-operate?
Don't just sit there and vegetate.
Do you want to end up illiterate?
You think that life's a vacation
And you've no inclination
To dust away the cobwebs of your mind.
Now it's time for confrontation
And I'm tired of being patient,
So I've got to be cruel to be kind.
Yeah, I've got to be cruel to be kind.

I'm wasting my vocation teaching you to write neat
When you're only fit to sweep the streets.
Your intellect is such
That it requires a killer's touch.

So I'm going to play it your way,
We'll take the hard way.
Going to take the hard way,
You can take the hard way.
Gonna take the hard way,
Gonna take the hard way.

_SOT The Last Assembly _EOT
 
As I walked to the last assembly,
There were tears in the back of my eyes,
And I saw all my friends all around me,
They were there to wish me goodbye.

As I stood in a line with my comrades,
I felt such a feeling of pride,
And I forgot all the grief and the hatred inside,
As we sang for the very last time.

Gather round, gather round,
Everybody gather round.
Come and join our last assembly,
Let us smile, wipe away all the frowns.

Gather round, gather round,
Everybody gather round.
As we stood at the last assembly,
All my friends came to wish me goodbye.

Gather round, gather round,
Gather round, gather round,
Everybody gather round.
As I stand at the last assembly,
I just can't keep the tears from my eyes.

_SOT No More Looking Back _EOT
 
Walking along a crowded street
I see thousands of faces before me.
Then I see a face that I used to know
Long ago in my life story.
It starts me thinking about the things you said
For your image is still inside me.
The past is gone but in my head
You're still walking along beside me.
Is it something playing tricks with my eyes
Or just an illusion deceiving me,
Or is it someone in a disguise
Or visions of things that used to be?

But lately I've been going to
All the places that we once knew,
And just when I think that I am free of you
I keep seeing the things that remind me of you,
And just when I think you're out of my head
I hear a song that you sang or see a book that you read.
Then you're in every bar, you're in every cafe,
You're driving every car, I see you everyday,
But you're not really there 'cos you belong to yesterday.

No more looking back,
No more living in the past,
Yesterday's gone and that's a fact,
Now there's no more looking back.
Got to be hard,
Yeah, look straight ahead.
That s the only way it's going to be,
Yesterday's gone and that's a fact,
Now there's no more looking back,

Perhaps someday I'll stop needing you,
Then maybe one day I'll be free of you.
But lately I've been going to
All the places that remind me of you.
And just when I think you're out of my head
I hear a record you played or see a book that you read.
Then you're in every bar, you're in every cafe,
You're driving every car, I see you everyday
But you're not really there 'cos you belong to yesterday.

No more looking back,
No more living in the past.
Yesterday's gone, that's a fact,
Now there's no more looking back.
No more looking back.
No more living in the past.
Yesterday's gone, that's a fact.
Now there's no more looking back.

_SOT Life On The Road _EOT
 
Ever since I was a child,
I loved to wander wild
Through the bright city lights,
And find myself a life I could call my own.
It was always my ambition
To see Piccadilly,
Ramble and roam around Soho
And Pimlico and Savile Row,
And walk down the Abbey Road.
So I saved all my money
And packed up my clothes,
And I said good-bye to my friends
And my folks back home.
And I left for a life of my own.
I left for a life on the road.

I'm a real hungry tyke,
And I know what I like.
And I know where I'm goin':
To those bright city lights.
Oh yeah, oh yeah,
This time I'm gonna get there.
I'm bound for a life on the road.
Give me life on the road.
I said life on the road.

When I arrived in Euston,
I was little more than a child.
And I didn't know then
That the dives and the dens
Would be so vulgar and wicked and wild.
Mama always told me
The city ladies were bawdy and bold.
And so I searched night and day
To catch a kissable lady,
But all that I caught was a cold,
'Cause those stuck-up city ladies
Didn't notice me walk by.
Now I've got holes in my shoes
'Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night.
And I'm livin' the life that I chose.
Livin' my life on the road.
I said life on the road.
I want life on the road.
Life on the road.

I was standing with the punks in Praed Street,
When a muscle man came my way.
He said, "Hey, are you gay?
Can you come out and play?"
And like a fool, I went and said, "O.K."
Ever since I was knee high,
I thought the city was paved with gold.
But I've seen so many losers
And down and out boozers
Who were tired of bein' bought and sold.
City women are a tease,
But I'd really love to please.
Now I've got blood shot eyes
'Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night.
And it sure knocks you out on the road.
And I'm livin' my life on the road.
I said life on the road.
Life on the road.
I want life on the road.

One of these days,
I wanna go home,
Visit my friends,
And see all the places that I used to know,
And say good-bye to a world that's too real;
Good-bye to a world that's forgotten how to feel.
And it's slowly usin' me,
And there's no security.
Sometimes I hate the road,
But it's the only life I know.
But I'm livin' the life that I chose,
So I'll live out my life on the road.

Give me life on the road.
I said life on the road.

_SOT Mr. Big Man _EOT
 
I remember when you started out,
You were the best friend I ever knew.
I tried to meet you when you had your success,
But you had better things to do.
Now I bet that you're losin' count
Of the people that you used.
But now we're gonna see the vicious side of you,

Mister Big.
You've got the say and the power.
Your minions grovel and cower.
But I see you, and I see me.
But you're the big man now.
You got it, Mister Big.
Your followers kiss your hand,
And your slaves all at your feet.
Your minions serve your beck and call,
But they don't compensate at all,
'Cause inside, Mister Big's very small.

When you were poor and knockin' at the door,
You were really lots of fun.
But now you're hot and you're sittin' on the top;
You've got no time for anyone.
You schemed and connived.
You pushed and you lied,
Till you at last became a star.
But now we're gonna see the way you really are,

Mister Big.
Now your vict'ry is complete
And your battles are all won.
Your enemies and foes are all stacked up in rows,
Eliminated one by one.
You got it, Mister Big.

_SOT Sleepwalker _EOT
 
Ev'rybody got problems, buddy.  I got mine.
When midnight comes around, I start to lose my mind.
When the sun puts out the light,
I join the creatures of the night,
Oh yeah.

I'm a sleepwalker.
I'm a night stalker.
I'm a street walker.
I'm a night hawker.

Ev'rybody got secrets that they wanna hide.
When midnight comes along, I take a look inside.
Don't go talkin' in your sleep:
I might come in for a peep,
Oh yeah.'

I'm a sleepwalker.
I'm a night stalker.

When ev'rybody's fast asleep, I start to creep.
Through the shadows of the moonlight, I walk my beat.
Better close your window tight:
I might come in for a bite,
Oh yeah.

When the night time comes, I start to creep.
I prowl around when you're fast asleep.
I walk around on my tippy toes,
And I get into places that nobody knows.

I'm always around if you wanna meet.
You can find me on almost ev'ry street.
You'll always get me on the telephone.
I'll even come to your home if you're ever alone.

I'm a sleepwalker.
I'm a night stalker.
I'm a street walker.
I'm a night hawker.

_SOT Brother _EOT
 
The world's goin' crazy and
Nobody gives a damn anymore.
And they're breakin' off relationships and
Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores.
For them it's all over,
But I'm gonna stay.
I wouldn't leave anyway.
I know that someday we'll find a way.
We'll be O.K.

'Cause I'm your brother,
Though I don't even know your name.
I've discovered that,
Deep down inside, you feel the same.
Our friends are leavin'.
Now they seem so far away.
But we shouldn't feel afraid.
There's so much that we can say.
You're my brother,
Though I didn't know you yesterday.
I'm your brother.
Together we can find a way.

The world's goin' crazy and
Nobody gives a damn anymore.
And they're breakin' off relationships and

Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.
There's so much that we can share.

_SOT Juke Box Music _EOT
 
There's a lady plays her fav'rite records
On the jukebox ev'ry day.
All day long she plays the same old songs,
And she believes the things that they say.

Other ladies like to prance around
And flirt and dance the whole night through,
But she just sits and listens to her juke box records,
'Cause that's all that she wants to do.

She sings along with all the saddest songs,
And she believes the stories are real.
She let's the music dictate the way that she feels.

It's only juke box music,
Only juke box music.
It's only music,
Only juke box music,
Only juke box music.

Seems to me she's in a fantasy.
She's livin' in a world of her own.
And we all agree that she's a mystery,
Because she'd rather be all alone.

Ev'ry guy will do his best to try
To put that music out of her head.
Forget all the songs,
And just dance to the music instead.

It's only juke box music,
Only juke box music.
It's only music,
Only juke box music,
Only juke box music.

It's all because of that music
That we're slowly driftin' apart.
But it's only there to dance to,
So you shouldn't take it to heart.

Music, only juke box music.
Only music, only juke box music.

_SOT Sleepless Night _EOT
 
Oh, there's a rude little lady
Livin' next to me.
Oh, she sure loves someone,
But it ain't me.
Ev'ry night at twelve o'clock,
They start to rock with all they got.
They keep it up all night.
It just ain't right.

They O.K. by me, I'm not.
He and she, they all right.
Once they start, they never stop
Through this sleepless night.
Once I was her lover.
It was so good to be.
Now she's got somebody else and I can't sleep.
Ooh, nothin' hurts people more than other people do.
But what can you do?

Meanwhile, upstairs, they O.K.
Ev'rythin' is all right.
I wish that I could find a way
Through this sleepless night.
Ooh, this sleepless night.
Ooh, this sleepless night.

Ooh, that wicked lady,
She's got a hold on me.
Ooh, she doesn't want me,
But she won't let me be.
They play that music ev'ry night.
It rocks my bed; it shakes my light.
They ball with all their might.

Ooh, this sleepless night.

It's never been like this before.

All the people,
They're runnin'.
Ev'rybody's try'n' to hide,
To get away from that stormy sky.
Perhaps it's a sign
Of what we're headed for.

We're under a stormy sky,
Watchin' the clouds roll by.
But won't you let me keep you warm,
And leave the storm outside?
It's only a stormy sky.

I feel it.
Do you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feels like we're in for a stormy night,
But I can't see a cloud in sight.

I see it.
Do you see it?
Can't you see it,
See that warning in that stormy sky.
But perhaps its gonna pass us by,
So don't you cry.
There's nowhere we can hide.

But if you hold me tight,
I know that we'll be all right.
Tomorrow we'll laugh about it;
Greet the mornin' light.
It's only a stormy sky.

We're under a stormy sky,
Watchin' the clouds roll by.
But there'll be another dawn
To clear the storm away,
And we will be all right.

_SOT Full Moon _EOT
 
Haven't you noticed a kind of madness in my eyes?
It's only me, dear, in my midnight disguise.
Pay no attention if I crawl across the room.
It's just another full moon.

Don't be afraid of me when I'm walking in my sleep.
Don't get alarmed, dear, when I start to crawl and creep.
Try not to listen when I mumble like a loon.
It's just another full moon.
It's just another full moon.

You see before you a truly broken man.
'Cause when it gets to midnight, I don't know who I am.
Full moon's a-callin', and it's put a curse on me,
And it will never set me free.

The full moon's still up there,
Like a great white balloon.
The owls are a-callin',
And they're singin' my tune.
The night keeps a-callin'.
I wish the day would come soon,
To get away from another full moon.
Here comes another full moon.

If your hands start shakin'
When night starts to fall,
If you're scared of the moonlight
And the shadows on the wall,
If the face in the mirror
Isn't you at all,
It's just another full moon.
It's just another full moon.

La la la la la la.
La la la la la la.
La la la la la la.
La la la la la la.
It's just another full moon.

_SOT Life Goes On _EOT
 
A friend of mine just had a real bad time.
You see, his life was shattered and he lost his mind.
His girl ran off along with his best friend,
And through emotional stress he brought his life to an end.
It was such a tragedy,
But that's the way it's got to be.
Life goes on.

Life goes on.
It happens ev'ry day.
So appreciate what you got
Before it's taken away.
Life will hit you
When you're unprepared,
So be grateful and take all
That you can while you're there.
Get that frown off your head,
'Cause you're a long time dead.
Life goes on and on and on.
Life goes on and on and on.

No use runnin' 'round lookin' scared,
Life could get you when you're unaware.
One day it's gonna come, so you better accept it.
Life will hit you when you least expect it.
And one day when you are gone,
You know that life will still go on.
But no one'll care if you've been good, bad, right or wrong.
Life will still go on.

My bank went broke and my well ran dry.
It was almost enough to contemplate suicide.
I turned on the gas, but I soon realized
I hadn't settled my bill so they cut off my supply.
No matter how I try, it seems I'm too young to die.
Life goes on and on and on.
Life goes on and on and on.

Tornado, cyclone and hurricane
Can batter the houses with the thunder and rain.
Blizzards can blow; the waves hit the shore,
But the people recover and come back for more.
Somehow the people fight back, even the future looks black.
Life goes on and on and on.
Life goes on and on and on.

_SOT Artificial Light _EOT
 
Slow dancing in a disco,
Standing underneath the light show,
Illuminated by the artificial light.

I disbelieved it at first sight,
I couldn't tell if she was black or white,
It didn't matter in the artificial light,
Artificial light.
Artificial light.
Artificial light.
Artificial light.

First time I saw her she was easy to know,
She had nothing to hide, she put it all out to show.
She didn't cover up or try to conceal,
I knew the way that she felt 'cause her expression was real.
She didn't cover up the inside,
She showed it all on the outside,
Stark naked in the artificial light.

Everybody gotta learn to relax,
To be yourself you have to put on an act.
Get together in the artificial light.

And if I saw her in the light of day,
I wouldn't know what to say, I wouldn't know what had happened.
I only wanna know a world below,
Where we can be ourselves beneath an artificial glow.

And if you're scared what your friend'll say,
And you're embarrassed by the light of day,
Get together in the artificial light.

Everybody let yourself go,
Everybody to a floor show,
Get together in the artificial light.
Artificial light,
Artificial light,
Artificial light,
Artificial light.

_SOT Prince Of The Punks _EOT
 
A well known groover, rock 'n' roll user,
Wanted to be a star.
But he failed the blues, and he's back to loser,
Playing folk in a country bar.

Reggae music didn't seem to satisfy his needs.
He couldn't handle modern jazz,
'Cause they play it in difficult keys.
But now he's found a music he can call his own,
Some people call it junk, but he don't care,
He's found a home.

He's the prince of the punks and he's finally made it,
Thinks he looks cool but his act is dated.
He acts working class but it's all bologna,
He's really middle class and he's just a phony.
He acts tough but it's just a front,

He's the prince of the punks and he's finally made it,
Thinks he looks cool but his act is dated.

He tried to be gay, but it didn't pay,
So he bought a motorbike instead.
He failed at funk, so he became a punk,
'Cause he thought he'd make a little more bread.

He's been through all of the changes,
From rock opera to Mantovani.
Now he wears a swastika band
And leather boots up past his knees.

He's much too old for twenty-eight,
But he thinks he's seventeen,
He thinks he's a stud,
But I think he looks more like a queen.

He's the prince of the punks and he's finally made it,
Thinks he looks cool but his act is dated.
He talks like a Cockney but it's all bologna,

Hey, it don't bother me,
But there's a guy eyein' you
He's watched you all night and he's looked you all over
He got his eye on you
But don't act like you're surprised
Because that smooth-looking guy's undressing you with his eyes

Look at him look you over
He thinks he can win you over
He'll flirt for a while, make passes and smile at you
But he'll never come over
'Cause he's just a poseur
Who thinks he's a Cassonova

That dude standing over there
He thinks he really looks cool
The ladies think he looks smooth
But he's rehearsed every move
He stands in front of the mirror all day
Now he's on display and he's so well routined
We've all come here to dance but he's just here to be seen

Look at him bossa nova
Look at him move and sway
But he's been practicing days to make his hair fall a certain way
But he'll never come over

_SOT On The Outside _EOT
 
You stay at home,
All on your own with nothing but walls to talk to.
You never go anywhere,
You say you've nothing to wear,
So you keep all your troubles inside of you.
There's something hidden in you,
And you keep it out of view.
You shouldn't feel any guilt,
Or have any doubts,
You gotta let yourself out whilst there's something left of you

Hey baby blue,
Don't hide your troubles inside.
I'd sure like to knoe you,
And there's so much to show you on the outside.
Somehow I know that we are goona get by,
So stop acting like a ladfy come and cry like a baby on the outside
Outside
I know that the weather is fine,
Outside
I know we're gonna be alright.
Somehow I know that we are goonna survive.
So stop acting like a lady come and cry like a baby on the outside
On the outside

You think you're a freak,
And you're afraid to compete,
In a world that you thinks got it down on you,
You're a closet queen,
You think it's obscene,
To let the people see what's deep inside of you.
I know what you're going through,
But what you are is nothing new,
So don't feel ashamed
'Cos you're not to blame,
Role up the blinds and let the sun come shining through.

Hey baby blue
Don't hide your troubles inside,
You should be glad in the gay,
Nobody cares anyway on the outside.
Somehow I know that we are gonna get by,
So stop acting like a lady come and cry like a baby on the outside.
Outside
I know that the weather is fine
Outside
I know it's gonna be alright.
Somehow I know that we are gonna get by,
So stop acting like a lady come and cry like baby on the outside.

_SOT Misfits _EOT
 
You've been sleeping in a field but you look real rested
You set out to outrage but you can't get arrested
You say your image is new, but it looks well tested
You're lost without a crowd yet you go your own way

You say your summer has gone
Now the winter is crawlin' in
They say that even in your day
Somehow you never could quite fit in
Though it's cold outside
I know the summer's gonna come again
Because you know what they say
Every dog has his day

You're a misfit, afraid of yourself so you run away and hide
You've been a misfit all your life
Why don't you join the crowd
And come inside
You wander round this town like you've lost your way
You had your chance in your day
Yet you threw it all away
But you know what they say
Every dog has his day

Look at all the losers and the mad eyed gazers
Look at all the loonies and the sad eyed failures
They've given up living 'cos they just don't care
So take a good look around
The misfits are everywhere
La la la la la la

This is your chance, this is your time
So don't throw it away
You can have your day
'Cause it's true what they say
Every dog has his day

You're a misfit
Afraid of yourself so you run away and hide
You've been a misfit all your life
But why don't you join the crowd and come inside
You wander round this town
Like you've lost your way
You had your chance in your day
Yet you threw it all away
Now you're lost in the crowd
Yet, still go your own way

_SOT Hay Fever _EOT
 
Sitting by my stereo all alone
My baby calls me on the telephone
She says, Baby take me out for a dance
I tell my baby I feel so bad
I can't go out and it's making me sad
But when you see me, I know you will understand

I got hay fever, blocking up my head
Hay fever, I ought to be in bed
How can I dance when I can hardly breathe
Wish I could cure this infernal allergy
I got hay fever blocking up my brain
Hay fever, feel the sinus pains
And all the pills and the powders are in vain
Thought I was cured but here it comes again
It goes ooh-ah

The pollen count's getting higher and higher
My eyes are sore and my nose is on fire
My throat's dry now and I'm starting to perspire
My stuffed up head's killing all of my desire
I got hay fever, you wicked allergy
Hay fever, you put the curse on me
And I've inhaled every know remedy

I can't stay cool 'cos I'm starting to sneeze
I can't make love when I can't hardly breathe
We start to dance and my nose starts to bleed
There must be a cure for this hay fever
Is there a pill or a powder I can take
I must get a cure, my romance is at stake

Hay fever, you tore my image down
Hay fever, I must look like a clown
I must have used every tissue in town
I'm running round sniffin' like a hound
I go ooh-ah

I wanna kiss but I'm sneezin' instead
I can't make love when my head feels like lead
How can I pose when my nose is all red
We should be home, should be tucked up in bed
But I got hay fever
Hay Fever

Hay Fever
Hay Fever
Hay Fever

_SOT Live Life _EOT
 
Have you heard about trouble throughout the land
With the fascists and the left wing militants
Out of work executives are killing themselves
And the I.R.A. are killing everybody else
Don't panic, don't lose control
Keep your head, keep a hold
Act normal, there's nothing wrong
Stay cool, just carry on

You gotta live life and be yourself
You can't live life for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Don't get depressed when you read in the press
About world revolution and social unrest
Try not to panic when you switch on the news
And see the crooked politicians and the unemployment queues
It's only life, it's really fine
So don't you believe all you read in the headlines
Live life, see it through
Carry on, it's all you can do

You gotta live life for yourself
You can't live for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Trendy intellectuals always take action,
For every cause that's ever been in fashion
Weekend revolutionaries protest and sing
Because they're dedicated followers of any old thing
They got every solution for every revolution
They live in the slums just like the poor people do
But they'd rather sniff coke instead of glue
Right-wing fascists beat up the blacks
Then they salute the Union Jack
You can't pretend there's nothing wrong
It's not the end, so just carry on

You gotta live life for yourself
You can't live for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother
Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother

You gotta live life for yourself
Can't live life for anyone else
You gotta live life, that's all you can do
Nobody gonna live your life for you

Live life, you gotta live life
You gotta live life, you gotta live life

Hello you, hello me, hello people we used to be
Isn't it strange, we never changed
We've been through it all yet we're still the same
And I know it's a miracle we still go, and for all we know
We might still have a way to go

Hello me, hello you, you say you want out
Want to start anew, throw in your hand
Break up the band, start a new life, be a new man
But for all we know, we might still have a way to go
Before you go, there's something you ought to know

There's a guy in my block, he lives for rock
He plays records day and night
And when he feels down he puts some rock 'n' roll on
And it makes him feel alright
And when he feels the world is closing in
He turns his stereo way up high

He just spends his life living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life living on the edge of reality
He just spends his life in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life living on the edge of reality
He just spends his life in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy

Look at me, look at you
You say we've got nothing left to prove
The King is dead, rock is done
You might be through but I've just begun
I don't know, I feel free and I won't let go
Before you go, there's something you ought to know

Dan is a fan and he lives for our music
It's the only thing that gets him by
He's watched us grow and he's seen all our shows
He's seen us low and he's seen us high
Oh, but you and me keep thinking
That the world's just passing us by

Don't want to spend my life living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
Don't want to spend my life living on the edge of reality
Don't want to waste my life hiding away anymore
Don't want to spend my life living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy

_SOT In A Foreign Land _EOT
 
It was a matter of fact that when I paid all my tax
I held my world in the palm of my hand
And all of my debts were causing me to defect
To a land of bananas and sand
So I ran, yes I ran, yes I ran to a foreign land
Here I am, here I am
Here I am in a foreign land

I'm so glad we made it
I thought we'd never land
I grabbed all my cash
And I decided to dash far away
Far away, far away in a foreign land
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land

Goodbye to all of the rich men's daughters
Goodbye to my debts now I'm way across the water
Far away, far away in a foreign land
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Please tell my mother and all my ex-lovers
That I've finally made the grade

Please tell my debtors and the money collectors
That all of my bills will be paid some day
I'm away, I'm away in a foreign land

Goodbye champagne and the caviar set
I wanna slum and drink all of the rum I can get
I'm away, I'm away in a foreign land
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land
But I'm all out of my jack and I can't go back
I'm away, far away, far away in a foreign land

Please call a doctor, I've been so depressed
That I think that I'm finally breakin'
I can't quite explain, I can't feel any pain
But I know that this time I'm not fakin'
Oh, what can it be, oh, inside of me

I saw my doctor he said man you look sick
He said I think you better do something quick
He checked me over and he said I was fit
What you need is a change, have a shave, find a chick
Your body functions but your hair's a disgrace
You shouldn't let it hang all over your face
Change your image 'cos you look out of place
Comb your hair, put on weight, try to look up to date
Why don't you put in some permanent waves
You'll look smooth, you'll look cool, you'll be laughing
You'll get lots of dates, you'll be made, you'll get laid
You'll get out and about, you'll be laughing
Oh, you'll be O.K. once you get those permanent waves

I was really up but now I'm down once again
I went out walking and it started to rain
My perm washed out it just got flushed down the drain
My neurosis returned, I'm a wreck once again
But wait 'til I get back my permanent waves
I'll be cool, I'll be smooth, I'll be laughing
I'll be all the rage in my permanent waves
And I'll start a new craze, I'll be laughing
Oh, I'll be O.K. once I get my permanent waves

But if I told you that God was black

I bet you wouldn't believe it

There's a self made prophet living right next to me
He said the Black Messiah's gonna come and set the whole world free
He looked at me with his evil eye and prophesied
And he really believed it

He said a Black Messiah is gonna set the world on fire
And he no liar, 'cos he has truly heard the word
Everybody talk about racial equality
But I'm the only honky living on an all black street
They knock me down 'cos they brown and I white
Like you wouldn't believe it

They say a Black Messiah is gonna set the world on fire
A Black Messiah is gonna come and rule the world
Everybody talk about racial equality
Everybody talk about equal rights
But white's white, black's black and that's that
Everybody got the right to speak their mind
So don't shoot me for saying mine

Everybody talking about racial equality
You hear everybody talking about equal rights
But white's white, black's black and that's that
And that's the way you should leave it

Don't want no Black Messiah to come and set the world on fire
A Black Messiah is gonna come and rule the world
Everybody got to show a little give and take
Everybody got to live with a little less hate
Everybody gotta work it out, we gotta sort it out
Everybody got the right to speak their mind

_SOT Out Of The Wardrobe _EOT
 
Has anybody here seen a chick called Dick
He looks real burly but he's really hip
He's six feet tall and his arms are all brown and hairy

He married Betty Lou back in '65 when you had to be butch to survive
But lately he's been looking at his wife with mixed emotions
You see, he's not a common place closet queen
He shouldn't be hidden, he should be seen
'Cos when he puts on that dress he looks like a princess

Well, the day he came out of the wardrobe
Betty Lou got quite a surprise
She didn't know whether she should get angry or not bat an eye
She really couldn't call up her mama
Mama would positively die
Should she go or stay, or should she try to get a trial separation

You see, he's not a faggot as you might suppose
He just feels restricted in conventional clothes
'Cos when he puts on that dress he feels like a princess

He's not a dandy, he's only living out a fantasy
He's not a pansy, he's only being what he wants to be
Now his life is rearranged and he's grateful for the change
He's out of the wardrobe and now he's got no regrets

Betty Lou didn't know what to do at first
But she's learning to cope at last
She got the best of both worlds
And she's really in a state of elation
She says it helped their relationship
She says a change is as good as a rest
And their friends are finally coming 'round to their way of thinking
She wears the trousers and smokes a pipe
And he washes up
She helps him wipe
'Cos when he puts on that dress he looks like a princess

He's out of the wardrobe and he's feeling alright
He's out of the wardrobe and he's feeling satisfied
Now it's farewell to the past
The secret's out at last
He's out of the wardrobe and now he's got no regrets

And all that it contained
I would see your face in a misty haze
And wish that you were there
Yes I wished that you were there
Darling Fool, I was with you all the way
Be as the flower that unfolds with each day

Trust your place in time though you have won and lost
How very much like me you are
When you come to me
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, oh truly trust your heart

Why bear malice just let it go
So what of pride it will swallow you whole
Here's to the judge, to the tyrant, and the beast
You keep a knockin' but you can't come in
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, truly trust your heart

The moonlight of your soul, told of memories long ago
Of the days when we were young
Of love that we'd forever hold
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, truly trust your heart
I bring thunder, lightning and rain
For those who administer injustice and pain
Comfort the weak and feed the poor
What on earth do we need government for?
Truly, truly trust your heart
Truly, oh truly trust your heart

You're in the middle while the big mouths fight

So get up off your easy chairs, we've got a lot to do out there
Well ain't we?
Good's gone bad, right is wrong, don't know which side I'm on lately

Get up from the down you're in
Come out of your homes and let's see your faces
Get up out of your easy chairs, get up and show 'em that you're there
Get up it's your one salvation
Wise up to the situation

Somebody gotta get up and shout
Somebody gotta give us some clout
You're the ones to make it all work out
It all depends on you

Get up off your arses men
Don't let 'em think you're getting lazy
Get up out of your easy chairs
We gotta lot to do out there, well ain't we
Get up, Get up, Get up,
Get up, Get up, Get up

_SOT Father Christmas _EOT
 
When I was small I believed in Santa Claus
Though I knew it was my dad
And I would hang up my stocking at Christmas
Open my presents and I'd be glad

But the last time I played Father Christmas
I stood outside a department store
A gang of kids came over and mugged me
And knocked my reindeer to the floor

They said:
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys.
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Don't give my brother a Steve Austin outfit
Don't give my sister a cuddly toy
We don't want a jigsaw or monopoly money
We only want the real McCoy

Father Christmas, give us some money
We'll beat you up if you make us annoyed
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys

But give my daddy a job 'cause he needs one
He's got lots of mouths to feed
But if you've got one, I'll have a machine gun
So I can scare all the kids down the street

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Have yourself a merry merry Christmas
Have yourself a good time
But remember the kids who got nothin'
While you're drinkin' down your wine

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
Father Christmas, please hand it over
We'll beat you up, so don't make us annoyed

Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread, so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

_SOT Attitude _EOT
 
You go down the pub
You wear make up
And old dads trousers
Why don't you tidy up
You talk like a docker but you act like a queer
You drink champagne then complain it's too dear
You try so hard not to follow any trends
Then you cry in your beer and say you've got no friends
But is it any wonder that you've got no friends
But it's not the make up
Or the way you dress
It's not your appearance, that they all detest
It's not your manners, that you gotta improve
Ooooo-it's your attitude.

[Chorus]
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude

Take off your head phones
Hear what's going on
You can't live in a time zone
You've gotta move on
But before you get there
There's one thing you've gotta do
Oh change your attitude
It's your attitude
It's your attitude

[Chorus]
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo

Attitude, Oo Oo Oo

The '80s are here, I know cuz I'm staring right at them
But you're still waiting for 1960 to happen

You might have the illness, but you've got the cure
You've got the answer, you will endure
You're the only person that's gonna pull you through
Ooh, with your attitude

[Chorus]
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude

You gotta learn to be positive, it's your only chance
You mustn't be so defensive, you gotta join in the dance
But it isn't your dancing that you've gotta improve
Ooh, it's your attitude.

[Chorus]
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo

Attitude, Oo Oo Oo

It's all the music
It's all in your brain
You've used all the old licks
Now it's all gotta change.
Change your attitude

I looked in the mirror what did I see
A nine stone weakling with knobbly knees
I did my knees bend press ups touch my toes
I had another sneeze and I blew my nose
I looked in the mirror at my pigeon chest
I had to put on my clothes because it made me depressed
Surely there must be a way
For me to change the shape I'm in
Dissatisfied is what I am
I want to be a better man

Superman Superman wish I could fly like Superman
Superman Superman I want to be like Superman
I want to be like Superman
Superman Superman wish I could fly like Superman

Woke up this morning, what did I see
A big black cloud hanging over me
I switched on the radio and nearly dropped dead
The news was so bad that I fell out of bed
There was a gas strike, oil strike, lorry strike, bread strike
Got to be a Superman to survive
Gas bills, rent bills, tax bills, phone bills
I'm such a wreck but I'm staying alive

[Look in the paper, what do I see,
Robbery, violence, insanity.]

Hey girl we've got to get out of this place
There's got to be something better than this
I need you, but I hate to see you this way

They were reduced in a sale so I shouldn't complain
They squeeze me so tight so I can't take no more
They're size 28 but I take 34

I'm on a low budget

[Quality costs, but quality wastes,
So I'm giving up all of my expensive tastes.

What did you say
Yea I'm on a low budget
I thought you said that
I'm on a low budget
I'm a cut price person in a low budget land
I'm on a low budget
Low budget
Low budget

Art takes time, time is money
Money's scarce and that ain't funny
Millionaires are things of the past
We're in a low budget film where nothing can last
Money's rare there's none to be found
So don't think I'm tight if I don't buy a round

I'm on a low budget
What did you say
Yes I'm on a low budget
I thought you said that
I'm on a low budget
I'm a cut price person in a low budget land
I'm on a low budget
Say it again
Low budget
One more time
Low budget

[I look like a tramp, but don't write me off,
I'll have you all know, I was once a tough
At least my hair is all mine, my teeth are my own,
But everything else is on permanent loan.
Once all my clothes were made by hand,
Now I'm a cut price person in a low budget land.
I'm on a low budget
I'll have you all know
We're on a low budget
I'm on a low budget]

_SOT In A Space _EOT
 
In a space allocated to me by the human race
Inhabiting this area until I die this space is occupied
I'm in a space leased by kind permission of the human race
Close up I am big but far away I'm small and hardly here at all
'Cause in a space out in space
We disappear without a trace

Now I'm out in inner space
And lookin' at the people. standing face to face
And filling up the space
Men and women boys and girls
There are so many people in the world
Thinkin' about the world
And all the people in it
And I'm staring at the stars
And into the infinite
In a world within a world
On a planet that's
Driftin' in a space

Seconds into minutes and minutes
Into hours and hours into days
And days into months and months into years
And years into decade tens into thousands
Thousands into millions, millions into billions
Billions into zillions and forever and forever

In a space allocated by the human race
Somewhere in outer space it's far away and I like it that way
Now I'm out in inner space
And lookin' at the people, standing face to face
And filling up the space
Men and women boys and girls
There are so many people in the world
Thinkin' about the world
And all the people in it
And I'm staring at the stars
And into the infinite
In a world within a world
On a planet that's
Driftin' in a space

In a space, in a space, in a space
Now I'm out in inner space
And lookin' at the people standing face to face
And filling up the space
On a planet that's
Driftin' in a space

_SOT Little Bit Of Emotion _EOT
 
See all the people
With hatred in their eyes
I can't help thinking that
It's only a disguise
Cause underneath that core
There's got to be more
Than what we realize

Maybe they're scared
To let the inside out
Maybe they're afraid to
Show what they're all about
So they put on a heavy front and hope that no one else
Can work them out
So they put on all the heaviness
But its only an illusion heaviness
Can't you see
They're scared to
Show a little bit of emotion
A little bit of real emotion
In case a little bit of emotion
Gives them away

Look at that lady dancing around with no clothes
She'll give you all her body
That's if you've got the dough
She'll let you see most
Anything but there's one thing
That she'll never show
And that's a little bit of real emotion
A little bit of true emotion
In case a little bit of emotion
Gives her away
But it's a shame she's acting that way
Somehow she's gotta get through every day
And the only way
Is not to show one little bit of emotion
A little bit of true emotion
In case a little bit of emotion gives her away

People learn their lines
And they act out their part
Then they talk on cue
But it's got no heart
It's all on the surface
And it's all contrived
They're scared to come out
Somehow they've got to survive

Look at that looney
With a smile on his face
He knows no shame
And feels no disgrace
He's got a look in his eyes
That makes it seem that he's from outer space
Maybe that looney knows what it's all about
He's got something to say
But he can't spit it out
He's unco-ordinated so we shut him out
In case he shows a little bit of emotion
A little bit of real emotion
We're afraid to see a bit of emotion
So we walk away
Show a little bit of real emotion
Show a little bit of emotion
We're afraid to see a bit of emotion
So we walk away

_SOT A Gallon Of Gas _EOT
 
I've been waiting for years to buy a brand new cadillac
But now that I've got one I want to send it right back
I can't afford the gas to fill my luxury limousine
But even if I had the dough no one's got no gasoline

I went to my local dealer to see if he could set me straight
He said there's a little gas going but I'd have to wait
But he offered some red hot speed and some really high grade hash
But a gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere for any amount of cash

I can score you some coke and some grade one grass
But I can't get a gallon of gas
I've got some downers some speed all the drugs that you need
But I can't get a gallon of gas
There's no more left to buy or sell
There's no more oil left in the well
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere
For any amount of cash

Two extra verses from long version:
I love your body-work, but you're really no use
How can I drive you when I got no juice?
Because it's stuck in neutral and my engine's got no speed
And the highways are deserted
And the air smells unnaturally clean.

It's got power-assisted overdrive and carpets on the floor,
But it's parked out front just like a dead dinosaur.
And I'll be paying off the bank for 45 years or more.
It should go 100 miles an hour,
But it's never moved away from my door.

Who needs a car and a seven-forty-seven
When you can't buy a gallon of gas
Who needs a highway, an airport or a jet
When you can't get a gallon of gas
There's no more left to buy or sell
There's no more oil left in the well
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere
For any amount of cash
You can't buy a gallon of gas

_SOT Misery _EOT
 
Misery
I know you got troubles but you don't have to spread it about
Misery
You moan and you groan but all of that I can live without
Well
Until you stop worrying about yourself
You'll never get anywhere with me
I'll still be hanging in there but you're still a misery

Until you learn to laugh you'll never come to any parties at my house
My house
And if you go on like this the only house you'll ever visit is the nut house
Nut house

You're such a misery, why don't you learn to laugh
Look in the mirror and
Don't take yourself so seriously

Well
Dollar bills could fall from the sky
But still you wouldn't be satisfied
But I'm not going to let you depress me

Until you learn to laugh you'll never come to any parties at my house
My house
And if you go on like this the only house you'll ever visit is the nut house
Nut house

You're such a misery, why don't you learn to laugh
Look in the mirror and
Don't take yourself so seriously
Ah ah ah ah

Misery
You're only happy when you're feeling totally down
Misery
I only ever see you when your chin's hanging on the ground
Well
Until you learn to laugh at yourself
You'll never get anywhere with me
I'm down but I'm still happy but
You're such a misery, well
You're such a misery, well
You're such a misery

_SOT Moving Pictures _EOT
 
Life is only a moving picture
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture
Oh no oh oh no

Black girls, white girls oh what a mixture
Looking as pretty as a picture
Oh no oh oh no

We live, we die no one knows why
We come, we go we see the show
And it's always moving, always moving
Life is only a moving picture

Oh, life can sometimes not be very nice
But then you make your choice so you must pay the price
You take the good and bad 'cos life's all work and play
And it soon fades away
Oh no oh oh no

Life is only what you make out
So make the verses rhyme and all the pieces fit
There isn't any time to make much sense of it
It soon fades away
Oh no oh oh no

Life is only a moving picture
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture
Oh no oh oh no

We live, we die no one knows why
We come, we go we see the show
And it's always moving, always moving
Look at all those moving pictures
Nothing in life is a permanent fixture
Oh no oh oh no

It's only moving, only moving, only moving pictures

_SOT Around The Dial _EOT
 
Radios of the world are tuning in tonight,
Are you on the dial, are you tuned in right?
One of our D.J.'s is missing.
Are you listening?
Are you listening to me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me clearly?
Around the dial.

I've been around the dial so many times,
But you're not there.
Somebody tells me that you've been taken off the air.
Well, you were my favorite D.J.,
Since I can't remember when.
You always played the best records,
You never followed any trend.
F.M., A.M. where are you?
You gotta be out there somewhere on the dial.
On the dial.

(Are you ready) We're going 'round the dial,
(Are you listening) Around the dial,
(Are you tuned in) Around the dial,
(Are you searchin') Around the dial.
F.M., A.M. where are you?
You gotta be out there somewhere on the dial.
On the dial.

Where did you go Mr. D.J.?
Did they take you off the air?
Was it something that you said to the corporation guys upstairs?
It wasn't the pressure,
You never sounded down.
It couldn't be the ratings,
You had the best in town.
Somehow I'm gonna find ya, track you down.
Gonna keep on searchin',
Around and around and 'round and 'round...

(They're searchin') Around the dial,
(They're listenin') Around the dial,
(Poor station) The best in town,
(Poor D.J.) Who never let us down.
While the critics kept on knocking you,
You just kept on rocking around the dial.
Around the dial.

I've been searchin' for you on my radio.
This time your station really must have gone underground
Somebody said you had a minor nervous breakdown.
Was it something that you heard,
Or something that you saw,
That made you lose your mind,
Did you lose control.
Did you step out of line?
If you're there, give us a sign.

I can't believe that you've been taken off the air.
Think I'll sell my radio now that you're not there.
You never gave in to fashion,
You never followed any trends,
All the record bums tried to hack you up,
But you were honest to the end.
Gonna keep my radio on,
'Till I know just what went wrong.
The answers out there somewhere on the dial.
On the dial.

Can you hear me (around the dial)
Are you listenin' (around the dial)
Are you out there (around the dial)
Can you hear me?
Around the dial.

_SOT Give The People What They Want _EOT
 
Hey, hey, hey...
Give the people what they want

Well, it's been said before, the world is a stage
A different performance with every age.
Open the history book to any old page
Bring on the lions and open the cage.

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please

The Roman promoters really did things right.
They needed a show that would clearly excite.
The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight
Threw the Christians to the lions, sold out every night

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please

Give 'em lots of sex, perversion and rape
Give 'em lots of violence, and plenty to hate
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want

When Olswald shot Kennedy, he was insane
But still we watch the re-runs again and again
We all sit glued while the killer takes aim
"Hey Mom, there goes a piece of the president's brain!"

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Blow out your brains, and do it right
Make sure it's prime time and on a Saturday night.
You gotta give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want

_SOT Killer's Eyes _EOT
 
I see so little hope in you,
So much despair,
As I look in your eyes I wonder,
What thoughts linger there.
Life means nothing to you,
At least that's what they say,
But it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.

How were we to know what was going on inside your mind.
You never let it show what was going on behind
Those killer's eyes
Killer's eyes

You've seen your picture in the paper.
You're little sister's pinned it on the wall.
She thinks you're in some kind of movie.
Imagine her surprise when she saw you on the news.
Reporters came around and asked for interviews.
So little compassion, so icy cool.
They say you were a poor boy, you know that life can be cruel.
Hate builds up from childhood, your world was a slum
But you haven't got the right to blow it to kingdom come

How could we know what it was like inside a killer's mind
It never really showed, you kept the secret deep inside
Those killer's eyes
Killer's eyes

You say the world is full of bullshit,
So you kill just as you see fit.
They say that you're a fanatic with a mission.
We all go through hell in some kind of way,
Can you tell me what it's like to be there every day?
When you were young you had a vision
Why'd you go and do a thing like that?
And now we see you on the television.
Imagine our surprise when we saw you on the news,
And reporters came around and asked for interviews.

I see so little hope in you,
So much despair,
As I look in your eyes I wonder,
What thoughts linger there.
Life means nothing to you,
At least that's what they say,
But it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.

When you were just a child
You'd hide away when other children cried
But how were we to know
These tears that flowed were from a killer's eyes

I see so little hope in you,
So much despair,
As I look in your eyes I wonder,
What thoughts linger there.
Life means nothing to you,
At least that's what they say,
But it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.

Those killer's eyes
See the whites of their eyes
Those killer's eyes
See the whites of their eyes

Don't know why I'm even bothering.
(Predictable)
Yeah, that's the mood I'm in.
Go out for a walk then I come back in.
(Predictable)
Yeah, the mood that I'm in.
(Predictable)
Every day of my life
Can't even communicate with my wife
(Predictable)
That's the word of the year
(Predictable)
All I see, all I hear.

Go to my office, sit at my desk,
Predictably just like all of the rest.
I sit and I dream about far away places,
Away from the people with frowns on their faces.
All of my life is monotony
I'd go out for a walk but I know it would be
(Predictable)
Sure as the nose on my face
(Predictable)
Same for the whole human race

Once we (once we) had so many options
Once we (once we) had dignity and grace
Now we (now we) have got nothing but our own time to waste.

Yeah, that's the word of the year
(Predictable)
All I see, all I hear
Why can't it be like never before?
(Predictable)
Yeah, ain't life a bore

Life gets more and more...
Just like I've heard it all somewhere before.
(Predictable)
Sure as the nose on my face

Same for the whole human race

One day (one day) it's gonna get better some way (some way)
I wish it would get worse any way (any way)
What can I lose, it might turn into something better.

It gets harder and harder the harder I try
(Predictable)
Feels like a good time to die
I kiss you hello then I kiss you good-bye
(Predictable)
Just like the stain on my tie
(Predictable)
Just like the jacket I wear
(Predictable)
The way that I'm combing my hair
Turn on the TV, just sit and stare
(Predictable)
There's nothing happening there

Yeah, that's the word of the year
(Predictable)
All I see, all I hear.

_SOT Add It Up _EOT
 
The first time that I saw you, you were modestly waiting for a bus
Now you're driving around in hired limousines
And you talk so upper class.

The cost is high, but it's not the only price you ultimately pay
Add it up, you might have got some money
But you lost me on the way

Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh

Ah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Cartier, Cartier
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci

Add it up,
You multiplied and multiplied but what's it leading to?
Add it up,
The only thing subtracted is the love I had for you
So add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh

Symbols of perversion and insanity
Symbols of social immorality
Symbols of economic cruelty
Symbolize all what you did to me

Ah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Cartier, Cartier
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Cartier, Cartier

Money can't cover up the fact you're getting older every day
And you can't disguise your sad little eyes that give your loneliness away

Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh
Add it up, oh

_SOT Destroyer _EOT
 
Met a girl called Lola and I took her back to my place
Feelin' guilty, feelin' scared, hidden cameras everywhere
Stop!  Hold on.  Stay in control

Girl, I want you here with me
But I'm really not as cool as I'd like to be
'Cause there's a red, under my bed
And there's a little yellow man in my head
And there's a true blue inside of me
That keeps stoppin' me, touchin' ya, watchin' ya, lovin' ya

Paranoia, the destroyer.
Paranoia, the destroyer.

Well I fell asleep, then I woke feelin' kinda' queer
Lola looked at me and said, "ooh you look so weird."
She said, "man, there's really something wrong with you.
One day you're gonna' self-destruct.
You're up, you're down, I can't work you out
You get a good thing goin' then you blow yourself out."

So much to aim for, so much to try for
You blowing it all with paranoia
You're so insecure you self-destroyer

Paranoia, the destroyer

Doctor, Doctor help me please, I know you'll understand
There's a time device inside of me, I'm a self-destructin' man
There's a red, under my bed
And there's a little green man in my head
And he said, "you're not goin' crazy, you're just a bit sad
'Cause there's a man in ya, gnawin' ya, tearin' ya into two."

Silly boy ya' self-destroyer.
Paranoia, the destroyer

_SOT Yo-Yo _EOT
 
There are many different people,
Livin' double lives.
One for the office,
And one that they take home to their wives.
He sits in the armchair, watching channel 4,
With his brains not expected home for an hour or more.
He's still drifting to and fro, like a yo-yo.

His wife is in the kitchen, fixin' her old man's tea
She's thinking to herself,
"He's not the man that married me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
They used to laugh together, now he's never at home.
Now she's fighting back the tears, she can't even laugh alone.
She's just sitting by the telephone, like a yo-yo.

You needed me when you were crying,
But now you're laughing I'm the last thing on your mind.
First you love me, then you don't.
I'm up and down,
Like a yo-yo.
Yo-yo.

Ah, you thought you knew me pretty well,
But with people like me you never can tell.
You can only guess which way I'll go.
You got me sussed, but you don't know,
I'm a yo-yo.
Just like a yo-yo on a string.
I'm a yo-yo.
Little child playing with a yo-yo.
Yo-yo, yo-yo.

Girl you had me dangling, like a yo-yo on a string,
But with you at the controls I could accomplish anything, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You were just playing, I was a little boy,
But when I grew into a man you just threw away your toy,
Like a yo-yo.
Yo-yo.

You might be popular, but it won't last for long,
So don't give up the day job, in case it all goes wrong.
Look at your ego, watch it go, up and down,
Like a yo-yo.
Yo-yo.

You needed me when you were crying,
But now you're laughing I'm the last thing on your mind.
First you love me, then you don't.

_SOT Back To Front _EOT
 
Just come back where I came from,
Looks the same as something's wrong.
And all my friends that used to be,
Have gone and turned their backs on me.
Everyone's got different views,
Now I'm all shook up and all confused.

East is West, left is right,
Up is down, and black is white,
Inside-out, wrong is right,
It's back to front and I'm all uptight.

I've just come back from fantasy,
Right back to reality.
Stayed away too long but now I've found,
My world is turning upside-down.
I don't fit in but I don't stand out,
I should stay cool but want to shout.

East is West, left is right,
Up is down, and black is white,
Inside-out, wrong is right,
It's back to front and I'm all uptight.

No one knows where I come from,
"Who are you and what do you want?"
You've thrown away all that we had,
It's down the drain, it's all gone mad.
The word is out, I've seen the sign,
So you go your way, I go mine.

East is West, left is right,
Up is down, and black is white,
Inside-out, wrong is right,
It's back to front and I'm all uptight.

East is West, left is right,
Up is down, and black is white,
Inside-out, wrong is right,
It's back to front and I'm all uptight (alright).
It's back to front and I'm all uptight (alright, alright, alright, alright).

Are you listening?
(NO!)
Well then, I'll have to do it all over again!

_SOT Art Lover _EOT
 
Sunday afternoon there's something special
It's just like another world.
Jogging in the park is my excuse
To look at all the little girls.

I'm not a flasher in a rain coat,
I'm not a dirty old man,
I'm not gonna snatch you from your mother,
I'm an art lover.
Come to daddy,
Ah, come to daddy,
Come to daddy.

Pretty little legs, I want to draw them,
Like a Degas ballerina.
Pure white skin, like porcelain,
She's a work of art and I should know
I'm an art lover.
Come to daddy,
And I'll give you some spangles.

Little girl don't notice me
Watching as she innocently plays.
She can't see me staring at her
Because I'm always wearing shades.
She feeds the ducks, looks at the flowers.
I follow her around for hours and hours.
I'd take her home, but that could never be,
She's just a substitute
For what's been taken from me.
Ah, come to daddy, come on.

Sunday afternoon can't last forever,
Wish I could take you home.
So, come on, give us a smile
Before you vanish out of view.
I've learned to appreciate you
The way art lovers do,
And I only want to look at you.

_SOT A Little Bit Of Abuse _EOT
 
One on the nose, one on the chin,
You bruise so easy, so why stay with him?
He uses you just like a human punching bag.
But you don't complain, you're too scared to speak.
Anyway, it only really hurts you when you laugh,
And when you eat.
But you can't break the pattern, week after week.
The bruises show,
But he must be special otherwise you'd just get up and go.
You'll never let us know
Exactly how you feel.
What's the use, the cynics say it's no excuse,
You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse.
You say it's okay,
But I say that it's not right.
You wind him up, but you're living in fear,
You keep going back but it ends in tears, oh.

That's quite a cut on the side of your head.
Is it from his fist, or did you really fall out of bed?
Oh, so uncouth,
Excuse me, is this your tooth?
Why do you stay, no one knows.
Do you really love him, or are you too scared to go?
You're always nervous and on the edge of tears.
You cry alone,
But you never tell us what it's like when you get back home.
No one will ever know
Because you never show.
What's the use,
Everyone says you've got no excuse,
You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse.
You say it's okay,
But I say that it's not right.
Oh, it's your secret, it's your life, who am I to criticize?
It takes two sides to know it's true,
And maybe, he'll stay in love with you.
No one will ever know,
Because you never show.

_SOT Better Things _EOT
 
Here's wishing you the bluest sky,
And hoping something better comes tomorrow.
Hoping all the verses rhyme,
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness.
I know that better things are on the way.

Here's hoping all the days ahead
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you.
Be an optimist instead,
And somehow happiness will find you.
Forget what happened yesterday,
I know that better things are on the way.

It's really good to see you rocking out
And having fun,
Living like you just begun.
Accept your life and what it brings.
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things.
I know tomorrow you'll find better things.

Here's wishing you the bluest sky,
And hoping something better comes tomorrow.
Hoping all the verses rhyme,
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the drudge and sadness.
I know that better things are on the way.

I know you've got a lot of good things happening up ahead.
The past is gone it's all been said.
So here's to what the future brings,
I know tomorrow you'll find better things.
I know tomorrow you'll find better things.

_SOT State Of Confusion _EOT
 
Woke up in a panic,
Like somebody fired a gun
I wish I could be dreaming,
But the nightmare's just begun.
There's flooding in the basement,
There's water all around.
There's woodworm in the attic
And the ceiling just fell down.
I'm in a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).
I'm in a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).

All the dirty dishes
Are still in the kitchen sink.
The tumble dryer's broken,
Now the telly's on the blink.
My girlfriend's packed her bags
And moved out to another town.
She couldn't stand the boredom
When the video broke down.
Don't know why I feel so bad.
Is it the weather, or am I going mad?
Don't know why I feel this way.
I don't know whether I'm coming or I'm going,
Can't cover up 'cause it's obviously showing.
It's a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).
We're in a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).
I don't know whether I'm coming or I'm going.

Should feel happy, should feel glad.
I'm alive and it can't be bad,
But back on planet Earth they shatter the illusion,
The world's going 'round in a state of confusion.

Standing on an island
In the middle of the road.
Traffic either side of me,
Which way will I go?
I should've stayed at home,
I should have never come outside.
Now I wish I never tried
To cross the other side.
I'm in a state (state)
State of confusion (whooooh).
It's a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).

Lyin' awake in a cold, cold sweat,
Am I overdrawn, am I going in debt?
It gets worse, the older that you get.
No escape from the state of confusion I'm in.
State of confusion I'm in.
Whooooh

_SOT Definite Maybe _EOT
 
Got a letter through the post that says I don't exist.
Apparently the new computer thinks I won't be missed.
We need more facts, perhaps you would find out and forward them.
There's no proof or trace or date or place or where or when.
Central Information's got no news today (today).
Is there a change in my position?
No decision, no decision.

All I ever get is a definite maybe.

Head office thinks I'm dead,
But I'm not even ill.
How do I get attention,
Tell me who I have to kill.
Is there a change in my condition?
Not today.
The answer comes with repetition,
No decision, no decision.

'Round and 'round the circle goes,
Stood in line but the counter was closed.
And when I ask who is responsible,
Nobody knows, "Try one of those."

All I want is a yes or a no,
(All he wants is a yes or a no).
But all I ever get is a definite maybe.
Tried to make my life a misery,
But they don't want to know,
They don't want to know,
They don't want to know.

And all I ever get is a definite maybe.
No decision, no decision.

Surely there must be a way to open all the doors,
And wade through all the petty bureaucratic little laws.
Frustration everywhere I turn, I just get more and more.
Everyone's got problems and they've heard all mine before.

Oh, I'm tired of making endless calls.
(Somebody help this poor man.)
Banging my head against the wall.
I walk along an endless corridor,
Then I knock on the door, then I realize
That I've been there before.
No one here can hear my case.
So all I ever get is a definite maybe.
When they say, "no news today, get back in the queue,"
What can I do?  What can I do?  What can I do?
No decision, no decision.
No decision.
All I ever get (no decision) is a definite maybe (no decision).

_SOT Labour Of Love _EOT
 
Marriage is a two-headed transplant,
Sometimes that's how it seems.
When the sex wears off it's all give and take,
And it's good-bye to all your dreams.
One head wants to go to a movie
While the other wants to stay at home,
And just like a two-headed transplant
You get the feeling that you're never alone.

Mr. and Mrs. Horrible are an example of what I say.
They used to be so in love, now they fight so much
That they've frightened all their friends away.
They never get visits from neighbors,
They've alienated everyone.
And what started off as all cuddles and kisses
Has finally become

A labour of love, labour of love.
The torment, the worry and woe,
Love's full of fears, bruises and tears,
That's the way that a true love grows.
It's a labour of love, labour of love.
It's a struggle, without a doubt,
But if they keep on trying, screaming and crying,
Somehow they're gonna work it all out.

It turned into a two-headed transplant,
But it started off as "Here Comes the Bride."
But cut off one of the heads and you'll soon find out
That the other just couldn't survive.
Because they couldn't stand to be separated
They're still each other's to have and hold.
And anyone who thinks the transplant is easy
Really ought to be told

It's a labour of love, labour of love.
The torments, the worries and whoas,
The battles, the fights, the bruises and bites,
That's the way that a true love grows.

They took the vows, for better or worse,
And they had it blessed by heaven above,
But what started so brightly as a tender romance
Turned into a labour of love.
Turned into a labour of love.

_SOT Come Dancing _EOT
 
They put a parking lot on a piece of land
When the supermarket used to stand.
Before that they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local palais.
That's where the big bands used to come and play.
My sister went there on a Saturday.

Come dancing,
All her boyfriends used to come and call.
Why not come dancing, it's only natural?

Another Saturday, another date.
She would be ready but she's always make him wait.
In the hallway, in anticipation,
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration.
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek.

Come dancing,
That's how they did it when I was just a kid,
And when they said come dancing,
My sister always did.

My sister should have come in at midnight,
And my mum would always sit up and wait.
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late.

Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight,
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate.

The day they knocked down the palais
My sister stood and cried.
The day they knocked down the palais
Part of my childhood died, just died.

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band,
And there's a car park where the palais used to stand.
My sister's married and she lives on an estate.
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait.
She knows they get away with things she never could,
But if I asked her I wonder if she would,

Come dancing,
Come on sister, have yourself a ball.
Don't be afraid to come dancing,
It's only natural.

Come dancing,
Just like the palais on a Saturday.
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to play.

_SOT Property _EOT
 
My bags are packed, I guess it's time for me to go.
I can't say where I'm headed, 'cause I just don't know.
When I think of what I'll be losing,
It's hard to move along,
But it's harder just to stay here,
Knowing that I don't belong.

I'll be in touch, don't worry, I'll be calling you.
I've got no plans, I'm not sure where I'm going to.
It's hard to keep from crying,
After all that we've been through.
I've taken everything I need,
Now all that's left belongs to you.

You take the photographs, the ones of you and me,
When we both posed and laughed to please the family.
Nobody noticed then we wanted to be free,
And now there's no more love,
It's just the property.

It's hard to keep from crying,
After all that we've been through.

Now that it's all over, now that you and I are free,
Now there's nothing left except the bit of property.
Started off with nothing, started off just you and me,
Now that it's all over you can keep the property.

And all the little gifts we thought we'd throw away,
The useless souvenirs bought on a holiday.
We put them on a shelf, now they're collecting dust.
We never needed them, but they outlasted us.

_SOT Don't Forget To Dance _EOT
 
You look out of your window,
Into the night.
Could be rain, could be snow,
But it can't feel as cold as what you're feeling inside.

And all of you friends are either married, vanished,
Or just left alone.
But that's no reason to just stop living.
That's no excuse to just give in to a sad and lonely heart.

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Don't forget to smile.
Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Forget it for a while.

'Cause darling, darling,
I bet you danced a good one in your time.
And if this were a party
I'd really make sure the next one would be mine.
Yes, you with the broken heart.

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Don't forget to smile.
Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Forget it for a while.

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Forget it for a while.

You walk down the street
And all the young punks whistle at you.
A nice bit of old,
Just goes to show what you can achieve
With the right attitude.
As you pass them by
They whisper their remarks one to another,
And you give them the eye
Even that you know that you could be their mother.
You do the thing you love the best.
What separates you from the rest,
And what you love to do the most?
And when they ask me how you dance,
I say that you dance real close.

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Don't forget to dance.

_SOT Young Conservatives _EOT
 
Have you heard the word?
The revolution's over.
Now the anger's disappeared
And the rebels are much older.
And the schools and universities
Are turning out a brand new breed of young conservatives.

Get yourself a brand new scene,
Keep your collars white and clean,
It's time to come and join the young conservatives.

Revolution used to be cool,
But now it's out of fashion.
Politeness is the rule,
And not an angry young man's passion.
And they've used up all the alternatives,
And they're rushing down the street to join
The young conservatives.
Conservatives.

Ban the bomb, oh how contemporary,
In your parents' car.
Another chip off the block, is that all that you are?
Look at all the young conservatives
Hanging out in the bars.
It's got to stop before it goes to fa-fa-fa-fa-far.

Get yourself some new attire,
Set your sights a little higher,
You're going to join the young conservatives.

The establishment is winning,
Now the battle's nearly won.
The rebels are conforming,
See the father, now the sons.
All the urgency and energy
Have turned into complacency,
Now the schools and universities are turning out a
Brand new breed of young conservatives.
Conservatives.

Rebel, rebel found a cause,
Now it's Hampstead not East End
And now he's such a well respected man.
The only action that you see
Is in the Sunday Times.
Content to sit in bed and read between the lines.

Rebel, rebel join the young conservatives.
Be a devil join the new conservatives.

It's a victory for order
Now they've beaten everyone.
The rebels are too old now,
And the young just want to be young.
All the urgency and energy
Have turned into complacency.
Now the schools and universities are turning out a
Brand new breed of young conservatives.
Conservatives.

Look at all the young conservatives.
Look at all the young conservatives.

_SOT Heart Of Gold _EOT
 
Growing up isn't easy to do,
Especially for one who always knew,
You would always come up second best.
Is that why you have such bitterness?

The apple of your father's eye,
And always by your brother's side.
Then a little sister came along,
And you found all the affection suddenly gone.

But underneath that cold exterior
I know you've got a heart of gold.
So aloof, so superior,
But you've got a heart of gold.

Watch out, don't get caught in the crossfire.
Watch out, she's still growing up, she's in a rage,
I guess she's reached that difficult age.

Growing up is very hard to do,
Everybody watching your every move.
Your private life always on view,
But jealously never really suited you.
But I know that

Underneath that rude exterior,
There's got to be a heart of gold.
Underneath that hard exterior,
Is a little girl waiting to be told,
You've got a heart of gold.
She's got a heart of gold.

I couldn't understand your attitude.
I only wanted to take a photograph of you,
But I was shocked when I heard what you had to say.
You picked up my camera, threw it away,
I didn't really mean to ruin your day.

Now I see you've got a little girl of your own.
Little princess suddenly grown,
And there's a man, he's smiling at you.
He must have been the one who always knew.
You had a heart of gold.

Underneath that rude exterior,
You've got a heart of gold.
So aloof, so superior,
But you've got a heart of gold.
Underneath that rude exterior,
You've got a heart of gold.
Underneath that hard exterior,
You've got a heart of gold.

Watch her, she'll give you a broadside,
But I know that inside,
She got a heart of gold.

_SOT Cliches Of The World (B Movie) _EOT
 
Sunset over the high-rise,
By a motorway,
A little man looks up at the sky.
An uneventful end to a wasted day.
Close-up on the man at the window,
Looking at the street down below.
It's obvious he's got things on his mind.
He shakes his head, pulls down the blind.

He start's writing a letter,
To make it perfectly clear.
He's just a man who's reached the end of his rope,
Expressing his doubts and his fears.
In a world, feels so lonely and afraid,
Disillusioned by the promises they made,
It's a pity that it ended up this way,
Life is just a cliche.

I'm gonna do tomorrow
What I did yesterday.
It's such a dull routine,
Somebody cut this scene,
It's such a boring cliche.

Live life, day to day,
Seems so passe.
Everything you hear and say,
Just another cliche.

Like an actor on a movie screen,
Living out someone else's dream.
Living out a total misconception,
Reality, a false perception.

It's such a wasted life,
Without any conclusion.

Days drift into days,
His life just slips away.
People so blase,
Everything's a cliche.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
Just an illusion.
Just an illusion.

Moonlight over the high-rise,
At the end of the day.
The little man is asleep in his bed,
Tucked up, safely away.

In his dreams he's taken away by alien beings to another
Galaxy, deep in space.  To a planet where a man can live
Out his fantasies, and experience unimaginable pleasures.
But morning comes and soon the realities of life will
Shatter his illusions, and the cliches of the world will
Bring him down.  But still he's waiting for a change.

Days drift into days,
His life just slips away.
Everything is passe,
Everything's a cliche.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
Just an illusion.
Just an illusion.
Yes it is.

Yes it is.

See the sunlight over the motorway,
The little man, with anger in his eyes,
Stands by the window, looks at the sky.

_SOT Bernadette _EOT
 
I don't wanna leave, Bernadette,
But I don't wanna live with the jet set.
I don't wanna leave with you payin' all my debts,
With that alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get.

Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
You've never done a day's work in your life,
You've got no incentive.
You've made a career out of punting off all of the men you've slept with.
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.

I can't get a job, Bernadette,
So all that I can offer are a lot of bad debts
If you marry me, Bernadette,
You'll lose the alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get.

Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
You've never done a day's work in your life,
You've got no incentive.
You've made a career out of punting off all of the men you've slept with.

Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette.
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette.

[Bernadette's got a house in the country,
She's really got it made.
Her lawyers made her filthy rich,
She's got all expenses paid.]

Maybe a famous rock star will fly you away,
Then you'll eat him all up,
And spit him out,
With a dash of Perrier.

And when you've had enough
You'll throw him away,
And take him for all you can get.
Yeah, you like it don't you, Bernadette?

I don't want to leave Bernadette,
But I wanna keep a little bit of self respect.
I don't want to leave with you paying all my debts,
With that alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get.
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
You've never done a day's work in your life.
You've got no incentive.
Women like you oughta be locked up,
For giving others a bad name.
Ohh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette.
Ooh, Bernadette.

_SOT Once A Thief _EOT
 
So you've decided to set me free
I've paid my debt to society
Fresh out of jail trying to make a new start
On the street with a bitter heart
But my past keeps on haunting me
There ain't no chance for a man with my history

Once a thief
Always a suspect
Once a liar
Never be believed
Will they ever forget that
I was once a thief?

I was out in the cold
I was soaked to the skin
I needed a home
And your heart took me in
Then I heard all the lies
And I lost my belief
You threw away my hope
And you called me a thief

So you've decided to set me free
I'm out of jail but you've still got the key
There was a time when I thought you respected me
But somehow you always suspected me

Once a thief
Always a suspect
Once a liar
Never be believed
Will they ever forget that
I was once a thief?

Instead of offering me charity,
You should've tried to put some faith in me
Instead of making me a better man,
You kept reminding me of what I am

Instead of offering me charity,
You should've tried to put some faith in me
How many years must a criminal pay?
Until he's old and his hair turns to gray
You smile at me
But I know underneath
You're thinking
Once a thief always a suspect.

Once a thief
Always a suspect
Once a liar
Never be believed
Will they ever forget that
I was once a thief?

_SOT Long Distance _EOT
 
Spent last winter playing in the sand
With the prisoners of the motherland
Damn hotel is feeling like a cell

And even paradise can be so cruel
Sitting by the swimming pool
Trying to keep my head together
In that hot Australia weather

Three days to kill and my per diem's getting low
'Cause I spent all my money calling long distance
Calling long distance, such a long way from home

Am I talking to long distance, can you put me through?
Twelve thousand miles but I've got not resistance,
Long distance, long distance, long distance, long distance

Now the Road Hog's face is turning red
Larry's still asleep in bed
Romeo he can't get no head at all
And the Doctor looks on so annoyed
You disappoint me, Mr. Boyd
And the Electric Dwarf wishes he was six foot tall

Now Romeo's patience is wearing thin
C'mon baby, let me in
It's five a.m. and I've been creeping 'round the hall
Got no resistance calling long distance
You sound so close but your such a long way from home

Am I talking to long distance, can you put me through?
Twelve thousand miles but I've got not resistance,
Long distance, long distance, long distance, long distance

Still no points for my merrymen,
Except Ricard, he just scored ten
Now Road Hog's getting drunk again
And I only get to hold my pen
Instead of what I love to hold the most.

I feel so lonesome I could cry
Count the hours as they roll by
It's day time now
I think I'll make a call

Hello long distance, calling long distance
You sound so close but you're such a long way from home
You're such a long way from home

Have to admit I got no resistance to the red light on the wall
The message said I got a call,
Long distance, long distance, long distance, long distance

_SOT Noise _EOT
 
Dad's stuck in the factory, machines are banging all around.
Momma's in the kitchen, she got the radio on all the time.
My little sister's screaming, and stamping on the ground.
And the radio keeps pumping out the same old boring sound.

All I hear is noise.
Can't get away from the noise.
Can you hear me above the noise?
Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you, can you hear me?

Can you hear the noise?  (Noise)
Can't get away from the noise.  (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise?  (Noise)
Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you, can you hear me?

Banging in my ears, in every direction.
Listen to the roar, hear that city[?], poundin', poundin'.
There oughta be a law, hey buddy, turn that radio down.
Sometimes I get used to it and I forget that it's around.

But all I hear is noise.  (Noise)
Can't get away from noise.  (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise?  (Noise)

All of this confusion is ruining my day.
Let the noise be like the sunset, and slowly fade away.
Fading, fade.

Girl, I want to build a better world for me and you.
I wanna pull out all the plugs before I finally blow my fuse.
Wish all the confusion would slowly fade away.
I'd tell you that I love you, but you don't hear what I way.

All you hear is noise.  (Noise)
Can't get away from noise.  (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise?  (Noise)
Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you, can you hear me?

Noise in the street, they're digging up the pavement.
Noise in the air, those traffic jams are everywhere.
Noise on noise, to cover up the noise.
The pressure's building up because there's no way to avoid,

All the noise.  (Noise)
Can't get away from noise.  (Noise)
Can you hear me above the noise?  (Noise)

All of this confusion is ruining my day.
Let the noise be like the sunset, and slowly fade away.
Fading, fading.

_SOT Do It Again _EOT
 
Standing in the middle of nowhere,
Wondering how to begin.
Lost between tomorrow and yesterday,
Between now and then.

And now we're back where we started,
Here we go round again.
Day after day I get up and I say
I better do it again.

Where are all the people going?
Round and round till we reach the end.
One day leading to another,
Get up, go out, do it again.

Then it's back where you started,
Here we go round again.
Back where you started,
Come on do it again.

And you think today is going to be better,
Change the world and do it again.
Give it all up and start all over,
You say you will but you don't know when.

Then it's back where you started,
Here we go round again.
Day after day I get up and I say
Come on do it again.

The days go by and you wish you were a different guy,
Different friends and a new set of clothes.
You make alterations and affect a new pose,
A new house, a new car, a new job, a new nose.
But it's superficial and it's only skin deep,
Because the voices in your head keep shouting in your sleep.
Get back, get back.

Back where you started, here we go round again,
Back where you started, come on do it again.

Back where you started, here we go round again,
Day after day I get up and I say, do it again.
Do it again.
Day after day I get up and I say, come on do it again.

_SOT Word Of Mouth _EOT
 
I've been trying to get a message to you,
But the operator can't put me through,
Because the vandals went and wrecked all the telephones.
And all my enemies are spreading bad news,
You won't call me, that's why I'm calling you,
To put you straight about the rumors they're spreading about me back home.

I should have known, sooner or later,
You'd get the news, sooner or later,
The word of mouth will get right back to you.

Somehow we lost communication,
My only chance in my situation,
Is that the word of mouth gets my message through.

The word of mouth,
The word of mouth,
But who are they to say the things they do?

The word of mouth says that I've gone insane,
That wine and women have affected my brain.
Well who's the big mouth spreading the news again?
The word of mouth says I'm round the bend,
It's all over, this is the end.
Exaggeration sure gets the better of people who send[?].

The word of mouth,
The word of mouth,
But who are they to say the things they do?

The word of mouth said I should be put in my place.
The word is out I'm in disgrace - a waste of space.
But if they say it, say it to my face.

People talking, trying to dig up the dirt,
There are so many lies around.
They spread their gossip and the rumors around this town.

Word of mouth, face to face,
My word of mouth has stated my case,
And I'm saying I'm coming back home to you.

You should have know sooner or later,
You'd get the news sooner or later,
The word of mouth will get right back to you.

The word of mouth,
Shut your mouth,
Shut your face!

_SOT Good Day _EOT
 
The sky is blue but there are clouds in my head,
With big decisions looming ahead.
The sun is out but the room is so grey,
So much confusion headed my way.
Get positive, try to be gay.

News of the world, tea and biscuits in bed.
The headlines said that Diana is dead.
She couldn't act much but she put on a show.
She always smiled even when she felt low.
I used to fancy her a long time ago.

So today has got to be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day.

Holes in my socks and I can't find my shoes.
It's no surprise that I'm singing the blues.
So many holes in my life still to mend,
And someone just said that the world's gonna end.

So today better be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Today has got to be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day, good day.

If we blow away the past with a bloody great blast,
Make it fast, make it fast.
So have a good day today because it could be your last,
Make it last, make it last.

Will it light up the sky?
Will it blot out the sun?
Well we've waited this long,
So it better be a good one.
Good day, good day, good day.

Yeah, it's gonna be a good day.
Hey baby, if you come back home it'll be a good day today.
They could drop a small atom bomb on the city today,
But if you walk through that door honey, you know it'll be a good day.

And now survival is my only aim.
I call friends and see if any remain.
Who was that girl who used to be my flame?
I'd call her if I could remember her name.

So today is gonna be a good day,
Today has got to be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day, good day.

Hey Diana, I've really got to learn to take a tip from you,
Put on my makeup and try to make the world take notice of you.
Yeah, it's gonna be good day today.

Good day, gonna be a good day.

_SOT Living On A Thin Line _EOT
 
All the stories have been told
Of kings and days of old,
But there's no England now.
All the wars that were won and lost
Somehow don't seem to matter very much anymore.
All the lies we were told,
All the lies of the people running round,
They're castles have burned.
Now I see change,
But inside we're the same as we ever were.

Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line,
Living this way, each day is a dream.
What am I, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?

Now another century nearly gone,
What are we gonna leave for the young?
What we couldn't do, what we wouldn't do,
It's a crime, but does it matter?
Does it matter much, does it matter much to you?
Does it ever really matter?
Yes, it really, really matters.

Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?

Now another leader says
Break their hearts and break some heads.
Is there nothing we can say or do?
Blame the future on the past,
Always lost in blood and guts.
And when they're gone, it's me and you.

Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line,
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line.

_SOT Sold Me Out _EOT
 
I always knew that they'd get me somehow sooner or later,
But with a bullet in the head, a knife in the back,
Not a pocket calculator.
Sorry mister, you're all wiped up,
You're all washed up,
Sold you out.

Got no dreams, got no ambition,
Can't decide, 'cause there's no decision,
Got no claim to any position,
Can't compete with the competition.
You're always complaining,
It's so depressing,
But if you're old enough,
Start to confess it.
You say, you sold me out,
To get a better deal for yourself,
You sold me out,
And now we want some of your precious wealth,
Because you sold me out.
Sold me out,
Sold me out,
Sold me out.

You sold me out,
To get a better deal for yourself.
You sold me out,
And now it's every man for himself.

Work all your life, put the money in the bank,
Sign on the dotted line.
Try to draw it out, the joke's on you,
Put up the empty sign.
Sorry mister, we're all sold out.

Sold me out,
Sold me out,
Sold me out,
Sold me out.
You, I'm talkin' to you.

You sold me out,
To get a better deal for yourself.
You sold me out,
And now we want some of your precious wealth.
And sell you out,
Like you sold me out.
Are you in so deep, that you can't get out?

Got no dreams, got no ambition,
Can't decide, 'cause there's no decision,
Got no claim to any position,
Can't compete with the competition.
Sold me out,
Sold me out,
Sold me out,
Sold me out.

_SOT Massive Reductions _EOT
 
I've been sacrificed in the name of the company,
I've been victimized for the sake of economy.
I had a big house, a big car,
Expense account and credit cards,
But now look what they've done to me.

They're making massive reductions,
It's all mass production and assembly lines.
They're making massive reductions,
Massive reductions.

They're laying me off all because of inflation,
I'm losing my job and my reputation.
Good-bye my big house, my big car.
Now it's all up to welfare,
I hear that everybody's going there.

They're making massive reductions,
Massive reductions to stay alive.
Whoa, they're making massive reductions.

Good-bye my big house, my big car,
Now it's all up to welfare,
I hear that everybody's going there.

They're making massive reductions,
Massive reductions to stay alive.
Whoa, they're making massive reductions.

_SOT Guilty _EOT
 
Stand before your maker, it will make or break you
While living for today
I know you, you are a faker, don't try me I will take you
While living for today

Don't stand in the light for the truth it will blind you
Secure in your offices of self-gratification
Deaf to the cries of the innocent strangers you buried
Don't look over your shoulder for the past is still burning
Or wriggle and squirm for your soul has forgotten
Controlling the man that through greed has brought misery to the world

Guilty until you're proven innocent
I'm sorry, but you've sealed your own fate
Guilty until you're proven innocent
Guilty because you looked/turned away

Power manipulators, conspirators, dictators
Drive the people underground
But we'll rise up through the ashes,
To stand where light can find us
In every nation, every land

You buy and you sell with no thought for the future
Controlling the masses in true business like fashion
TV, the media, lies and deception blinding us

_SOT Too Hot _EOT
 
Everybody's working out at the gymnasium,
Pumping iron, getting fit, ready to compete.
Everybody working on their own body heat.
Everybody hustling out on the street.

Julian is out there looking at locations,
Arthur's on the picket line winding up the nation,
Sara Jane's working on her way to a degree,
But back in the gymnasium they're working out and body popping.

It's gotta stop because it's getting too hot.
Cool it down, 'cause it's getting too hot.
It's getting crazy, going over the top.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.

All the kids are working out, they're on their way to fame.
Arthur's on the war path, here he comes again.
The city's like a sauna bath, stinks like a drain.
They're pumping up the nation but it's gonna bust a vein.
Tourists everywhere, blocking up the streets.
My ice cream cone just melted in the heat.
And while I do my best to stop my raspberry from slopping,
Back in the gymnasium they're working out and body popping.

It's gotta stop because it's getting too hot.
Cool it down, 'cause it's getting too hot.
It's getting crazy, going over the top.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.
It's too hot, gotta cool it down.
It's too hot, turn the heating down.
It's too hot, the temperature is up.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.

The city lights start shining at the end of the day,
Taking the place of the big red sun as it slowly sets.
Meanwhile back in commuter city, another kid's packing her bags,
And running away.

To a city that is really too hot,
It's Piccadilly and it's really too hot.
Too hot, too hot, too hot.

Arthur's working out, now he's really got the muscle,
Julian's over budget, now he's really got to hustle,
And Sara Jane's living on bag take-aways,
And working as a stripper on the school holidays.
Sleazy town, gets me down, want some peace and quiet.
The police are everywhere like there's gonna be a riot.
Back in the gymnasium they're training for a war.
Think of all the fun we had in 1984.

It's gotta stop because it's getting too hot.
Cool it down, 'cause it's getting too hot.
It's getting crazy, going over the top.
It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.
It's too hot, gotta cool it down.
It's too hot, turn the heating down.
It's too hot, the temperature is up.

It's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot, it's too hot.

_SOT Missing Persons _EOT
 
Have you seen this face?
Does it ring a bell?
Does it strike a chord somewhere in your mind?
And there's a big reward,
If you help us solve this crime,
And if you recognize this face, dial 999.

Have you seen this face?
Dig deep in your mind.
Has anybody seen that little girl of mine?
She was always a rover,
But I'm afraid to say she's strayed
Too far this time.

Now I'm sitting at home, staring at the wall.
Waiting for the missing person to call.
Waiting for the message I'm dreading to hear.
Waiting to confirm my darkest fears.
She's a missing person, I wish I could see
All of the places she might be.
Maybe I stopped her from being free.
Maybe there was something missing in me.

Wherever she is, I hope she's doing fine,
But I wish that she would phone or drop us a line.
Till then I've got nothing to ease my mind,
And I'm thinking about her all the time.

_SOT Summer's Gone _EOT
 
Looking in a window on a rainy day.
Thinking about good things that I just threw away.
Looking in the gutter, watching the trash go flowing by.
Thinking it's Summer, but there are only clouds in the sky.

When I think about what we wasted, makes me sad,
We never appreciated what we had.
Now I'm standing in a doorway with my overcoat on,
It really feels like Summer's gone.
So alone.
Summer's gone.

It should have been a laugh, it should have been fun,
When I think of all the things that we did last Summer.
Now I look back, it seems such a crime,
We couldn't appreciate it at the time.

Now I'm standing in a doorway, thinking of Summers gone by.
It ought to make me happy, but it just makes me want to cry.
I was riding in the car with my mum and dad,
He was drivin' the car, the kids were drivin' him mad.
Dad looked at us, then he looked at his wife,
He must have wondered where we all came from.
And then mum said, "Dad, you know it won't last for long,
Before you know it, Summer's gone."
So alone.
Summer's gone.

I really blew it all, when I think it through,
I really lost it all when I lost you.
Now I'm standing in a doorway with water in my shoes,
It really feels like, feels like Summers gone.
So alone.
Summer's gone.
Summer's gone, so alone.
Summer's gone.

_SOT Going Solo _EOT
 
She left a message after the tone,
I hear it over and over on the answer phone.
No one can find her, address unknown.
She just decided to go out and make it alone.

Solo, solo,
My little child is going solo.
Solo, solo,
My little child is going solo.

I feel like crying, I'm in a rage.
I can't understand why she just ran away.
What made it happen, guess we'll never know.
She just decided to go out and make it solo.
Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo.

We work like dogs all of our lives,
Like millions of other husbands and wives.
Sent her through college, didn't care what we spent.
Think of how we feel,
She didn't say, she didn't ask, she just went.

Solo, solo,
My little child, you're going solo.
It's like a pattern, it's like a crime,
We see it happen time after time.
You raise your children, you watch them grow,
Then one day it's good-bye, they've decided they're going solo.
Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo.

The toys are forgotten, now it appears,
You've let them down after all of these years.
Sacrificed all, now there's nothing to show,
Ungrateful youth, decided you're going solo.

Solo, solo,
My little child, you're going solo.
Solo, solo,
Ungrateful youth, you're going solo.

The obligations, all of the ties,
Have got to be broken so you can survive.
Just because they gave you life, they can't stop if you grow,
Now they can't hold you back 'cause you're going solo.

_SOT Working At The Factory _EOT
 
All my life, I've been a workin' man
When I was at school they said that's all you'll ever understand
No profession, I didn't figure in their plans
So they sent me down the factory to be a workin' man

All I lived for, all I lived for
All I lived for was to get out of the factory
Now I'm here seemingly free, but working at the factory

Then music came along and gave new life to me
And gave me hope back in 1963
The music came and set me free
From working at the factory

All I lived for, all I lived for
Was to get out of the factory
All I lived for, all I lived for
Was to get out of the factory

Never wanted to be like everybody else
But now there are so many like me sitting on the shelf
They sold us a dream but in reality
It was just another factory
I made the music, thought that it was mine
It made me free, but that was in another time
But then the corporations and the big combines
Turned musicians into factory workers on assembly lines

All we live for, all we live for
All we live for is to get out of the factory
We made the music to set ourselves free
From working at the factory

All my life I've put in a working day
Now it's sign the contract, get production on the way

Take the money, make the music pay
Working at the factory
All I lived for was to get out of the factory

Never wanted to be like everybody else
But now there are so many like me sitting on the shelf
They sold us a dream that in reality
Was just another factory

Working at the factory

_SOT Lost And Found _EOT
 
Waiting for the hurricane
To hit New York City
Somebody said it's hit the bay
This is the nitty gritty

And all the bag ladies
Better put their acts together
We're near the eye of the storm
This is really heavy weather

We were lost and found, in the nick of time
While the ship was going down
We were lost and found, just in time
With the hurricane crossing the coast line
We were lost and found, just in time
Oh

This thing is bigger than the both of us
It's gonna put us in our place
We were lost and found, just in time
Now we've got no time to waste

They're putting up the barricades
Because the hurricane is heading up this way
So won't you come in from the cold and the pouring rain
And the old see dog says shiver me timbers
The sky's gone black
And it's like the dead of winter

We were lost and found in the pouring rain
When the hurricane swept across the coast line

This thing is bigger than the both of us
It's gonna put us in our place
We're gonna see what really matters
When you see that storm stare us in the face

We were lost and found
And we beat the fear
We came through the storm
Now it all seems clear
We were lost and found, standing here
Looking at the new frontier

Lost and found, just in time
With the hurricane crossing the coast line

Lost and found, just in time
With the hurricane crossing the coast line

_SOT Repetition _EOT
 
You get up in the morning
And every single day
Is just a repetition
It's always been that way
You live alone inside your head
Incommunicado, in the land of living dead

Each day's a repetition
Of the one that went before
Like watching an old movie
You can't sit through anymore
Why don't you kick the habit
And walk right out that door?

From all the repetition
Day after day
All the repetition
It's always been that way

It's in your head, it's in your eyes
You're boring and it's no surprise
With all the repetition
Day after day
All the repetition

They say it's time to start all over
And call it a day
But you go right back where you started
Day after day
You go right back to where you started
Day after day, after day, after day, after day

You look in the mirror
Is anybody there?
It's only a reflection
That doesn't really care
You're a product of your time
Looking hard for something, but you never saw the sign

Lock inside a prison
But that's where you wanna be
Stuck in solitary
And you've thrown away the key
You say you want your freedom
But you don't wanna get away
Then you wake up, it's time for you
To start another day
With all the repetition, day after day, all the repetition
All the repetition day after day
Another chance, another day
You know it's time to get away from all the repetition
Day after day
How long you gonna sit and wait
You're getting on it's getting late

They say it's time to start all over
And call it a day
But you go right back where you started
Day after day
You go right back to where you started
Day after day, after day, after day, after day

_SOT Welcome To Sleazy Town _EOT
 
One hand on the controller
One hand on the re-wind
You can even watch it all in slow mo'
'Cos you just sit at home all day
Now you got plenty of time

If you want some real live action
And the video's too tame
If you wanna touch some heat
But you don't know how to light that flame
If you want some satisfaction
Instead of studying the freeze frame

I used to have this spot on Main Street
It was bounding, it was hot
It was dark, it was dirty
But dull it was not
The joint was jumping every night
But now it's just a parking lot

This city was cruel
This city was keen
This city was alive
This city was mean

Till the office blocks and parking lots
Came and closed this city down
I could stand outside
The kids hung round
And the neon sign said
Welcome to Sleazy Town
Welcome to Sleazy Town
Sleazy, Sleazy Town

Everybody hung loose
It was cool and easy
People used to meet and have a good time
Down in Sleazy Town, Sleazy Town, Sleazy Town, Sleazy Town

Then the corporations came along
And bought this piece of ground
The leases all went up
And so the buildings all came down
They built the motorways and shopping malls
And they killed off Sleazy Town

This city was cool
This city was keen
This city was alive
This city was till the office blocks and parking lots
Came and closed this city down
I could stand outside, the kids hung round
And the neon sign said
Welcome to Sleazy Town
Welcome to Sleazy Town, Sleazy, Sleazy Town
City Hall killed off that scene
Now Sleazy Town is just a dream

_SOT The Video Shop _EOT
 
The local factory's been pulled down
By an overseas corporation
Now all of my brothers are looking around
For alternative occupation

I was sitting by the telly with my brother, Kenny
When suddenly the penny dropped
While all of my brothers are sitting at home
I've got a bank loan and I've opened up my very own
Video shop
Video shop

At the video shop
I can fly, fly you away

Comedy and tragedy are all sitting on my shelf
And if you've got a fantasy
For a small rental fee
You can set yourself free
At my video shop
At my video shop
At the video shop

I can fly, fly you away
At the video shop
Let me fly, fly you away
From all of the depression in you head
Caused by all the living in the red

I've got a bootleg version of Citizen Kane
A second hand copy of Psycho
I've taped them off the telly so you shouldn't complain
And there's no guarantee you'll get your money back again
From my video shop
My video shop

If you want to escape, I can rent you a tape
To relieve your situation
If you feel a bit low, I got a good peep show
'Cos everybody knows almost anything goes
At my video shop
At my video shop

One fifty a day and I'll fly, fly you away
It's nothing to pay to fly far, far away
I can help you through that lonely night
I've got Technicolour, black and white
I can guide you through those empty days
Make you smile and take your blues away

O let me fly you away
At my video shop
Fly, fly you away

Another factory's been knocked down
But nobody ever complains
And all of my brothers are customers now
We all play video games
I can see it in the eyes of all the lonely wives
If they're bored and they feel like a change
I do sales, rentals, even a swop
And if you feel like a change, well it can all be arranged
At my video shop
At my video shop
At my video shop

At my video shop
Let me fly, fly you away

And everyone who walks in through that door
Has got something that they're looking for
At my video shop
At my video shop
At the video shop
I can fly, fly you away

At the video shop
Let me fly, fly you away
Oh, at the video shop

Oh, at the video shop
Oh, at the video shop

It's been a while, I haven't seen you for at least
A year or more, or is it less?  I can't be sure
Well, anyway, you must have heard about the
Troubles that I had, but somehow I got through
I always managed to... and by the way
How are you?
How is your life?
How is it going?
Are you still dreaming and making big plans?
How are the nights are they still lonely?
Are you still struggling the way that I am?  Oh
How, how are you?  How are you?

You always said that you would try to change
Turn a new leaf and start all over again
But I bet you're making all the same mistakes
You're a lot like me, that's why I'm still your friend
Still no offence, no more hard feelings left on silly sentiment
No harm was ever felt or ever meant
You go your way, I'm bound to see you on the street again some day
And when I do I'll always say
How are you?  How are you?

How is your life?  How is it going?

You're a lot like me that's why I'm still your friend
I bet go, I gotta thousand little things I better do
Ah, but it was really good to talk to you
Be on my way, I'm bound to see you on the street again someday
And when I do I'll say

Are you still struggling the way that I am?  Oh

Think visual, think visual, show your personality
Marketing says we gotta merchandise

We gotta budget to face and the marketplace is full of competition, competition
Think digital, synthisise, computerise, think visual
Productivity, marketability, higher and higher
Flash those teeth, open those eyes

She looks like a prima donna
She's a star in her head and the world's at her feet
She looks at you twice and your heart skips a beat
She didn't learn it at high school or from a glossy magazine
You see she's a natural, she gotta natural gift
You gotta rise above your stupidity
You're dumb but don't give in
You gotta rise above your station
Discover what's within
And with some luck and dedication and some careful manipulation

Everybody needs some inspiration
Everybody needs some motivation
Mix it up with some imagination
And use your natural gifts, you gotta natural gift
You got natural gifts
Ah, hey, hey, hey, ah, hey, hey
And use your natural gifts, you got natural gifts

You don't have to be a genius to find
All the hidden potential deep in your mind
You don't have to know about nuclear physics
Know all the formulas and vital statistics
You don't have to be an intellectual, you don't have to be a scientist
To use your natural gifts, you got natural gifts, yeh
Use your natural gifts, you got natural gifts
You gotta stop this depression you're in now
Stop this emotional rift, you need a psychological lift now
Everybody needs some inspiration, everybody needs some motivation
Mix it up with some imagination and use your natural gifts
There are bad people, mad people, bitter people, scared people
Wanna put you down and keep you in your place
But you gotta chance to break out, you gotta chance to get out
And use your natural gifts

_SOT Killing Time _EOT
 
Everybody's going somewhere
See how they stand in line
All complaining their lives are unfair
Too bad for them, too bad for mine

(It's the killing time) From now till then
(Killing time), Not knowing when

They're watching me, I'm watching them
Standing by the empty mine
(Killing time)

It's a killing time
I know it well
Killing time
Until the bell
Too late to change, too soon to tell
And in between, the killing time
(Killing time) Giving me hell

Up above the stars still shine
Through the poverty and grime
Of the empty streets below
Killing time, nowhere to go
(Killing time)

Tell me, brother what's the plan?
Will I be a working man?
And occupy my idle mind
Or kill the time I knew so well
(Killing time) Giving me hell

Still I can smile at what I see
Soap operas full of vanity
So much wealth and property
Side by side with petty crime

Is that all life's meant to be?
Commercials full of luxuries
A man has one, a cat has nine
And in between it's killing time
(Killing time)

It's a killing time
I know it well
Too late to change
Too soon to tell

Still I can smile at what I find
Waiting round and killing time
Bite the bullet
Help me through it
These lunatics will take my mind
Why can't life be more sublime
Than all of this waste and killing time

Killing time
I know it well
It's the killing time

_SOT When You Were A Child _EOT
 
We are born to this fantasy
Can't believe what they've done to you
Hard to see all these years go round
Taught to hide all that's true inside

What was it like
When you were a child?
Did you see the world
In a different light?
When the veil came down
Our destiny grew away from us
Don't it make you weep
Can't you see

I believe that we were meant for each other
We'll get along somehow
If they leave us alone
Why don't they let us be
...Just what we want to be
Don't it make you weep, can't you see?

I can't believe what they've done to you
They've got you just where they wanted you

When we sleep, dream each other's dreams
Casting memories on a sea of hope
Remember life as a child could be
Bring it back for all of us to see

What was it like
When you were a child?
How did it feel?
Did your mother treat you kind?
Mend those broken toys?

For in your heart there's innocence
Waiting to be free, can't you see?

When you were a child

_SOT Aggravation _EOT
 
Life grinds on day after day.
In the city streets and motorways.
The tension spreads just like a plague,
Killing reason on the way.
Like wildfire it spreads through the nation
Chocking us with aggravation.

Who needs it?  The aggravation the daily goddam hassle.
It's a bummer, who gives a dam?
Bumper to bumper in the traffic jam.
Clench your jaw, getting all up tight
Breathing fumes, stuck in a tin can,
Trapped, trapped.
Hate, frustration, no escape.
Glaring eyes all filled with hate.
Arteries throb, coronaries pound
Aggravation all around.
Like wildfire it spreads through the nation
Choking us with aggravation.
They won the peace, we lost the war.
So what are we still fighting for?
The highway's blocked, is this my end
To follow a Mercedes Benz?
Hey, Mitzibushi and Toyota, who said that the war was over?
Aggravations everywhere, get outta my way get out of my hair.
Another jam, another day, another hair is turning grey,
I wanna scream, I wanna say,
Get outta my hair, get out of my way
Who needs it?  Aggravation, aggravation
Had enough of all this aggravation,
Tension choking up blocking my circulation.
I've had enough, I've had enough of all this aggravation.
While traffic jams and tempers break,
The city streets are full of hate,
The lights are red, it's all too late.
How much can a poor man take?

Aggravation in my mind my body and my soul
There's no solution to it all, it's out of control.
Out of control.
Is it my imagination, am I seeing what is true?
If we are living in damnation,
I'd live in hell to be with you, what more can I do?

I gotta violent streak caused by
We're getting uptight, wanna fight, everybody back bite
Now we can't turn back the future's bleak,
I gotta mean appetite,
I gotta get my daily fill of aggravation.
Don't push 'cos I'm really pumped,
I'm ready when you are, punk.

So step aside, unless your dumb,
I'm all wound up with aggravation.

Had enough of all this aggravation
Winding up, stress filled, mad intimidation.
And it touches all the passers-by.
As dog eats dog to stay alive,
Then moves on through the population,
Till there's mass contamination.
With violent streets all filled with fear,
Pollution in the atmosphere,
The ozone's gone and that's no fun
I've had enough of this, old son
Who needs it?  Aggravation.
And I don't have any answers
I just got an attitude,
Do what it takes just to survive it,
Another day but I'll get through,
What more can I do?

_SOT How Do I Get Close _EOT
 
Living in a world where the flesh is cheap.
Body touches body but it's only skin deep.
I can hold you in my arms every time that you weep
But we've lost that emotional flow.
Living on a planet full of emptiness
With maximum exposure full of sleaziness
But the make up on your face can't disguise loneliness
Where designer feelings are in vogue, what do they know?

Darlin' Darlin' how do I get close to you when I'm
Trying, trying my heart is reaching out to you
How do I get close to you?
In this world without feeling,
Where words have no meaning,
If I were lying, lying,
I'd have more chance of reaching you but I'm,
Crying, crying, but I can't get my message through,
How do I get close to you?

Get close to the sinners trying hard to repent
Get close to the homeless wasters and the innocent
Get close to the souls ignored and forgotten by the
Establishment.
People get afraid to touch in case it rubs off on them
Gotta get close, yeah people gotta stay close, close.
People gotta stay close.

Though we seem together, it's breaking my heart.
This world is full of barriers that keep us apart.
Keep it superficial before feelings can start
In a world that's all glitter and glow, what do they know?

Darlin', darlin', I can't communicate to you without
Crying, crying, I can't get a message through
How do I get close to you?
How can I get close?
How can I get close?
Darlin', darlin', how do I get close to you when you're
Surviving surviving in a world that's making us confused
Guess I'm afraid of losing you.
In this world without feeling.
Somehow we gotta stay close.

_SOT UK Jive _EOT
 
Another Saturday night and everybody gets together
The pubs are turning out and all the streets are alive
But the people wanna party so they come back to our house
Everybody gonna do the U.K Jive
Dad's got a crate of beer and it's an open invitation
He's ever-so elated and so are his mates.
Everybody's welcome to bring all their dates home
To syncopate and celebrate the U.K. Jive.
Swing your partner to the left, swing he back to the right.
Don't stand in the middle and act cool all night.
Everybody act a fool, jump around, lose your mind
Celebrate and typify the sign of the times.

Do that U.K. Jive
Do that U.K. Jive
U.K. O.K. U.K. O.K. gimme that U.K. Jive
[Repeat]
You gotta swing to the left, then back to the right
You gotta learn to swing both ways.
When you're jiving in the U.K. O.K. U.K.

Mum's all annoyed dad forgot the inflation
He blew all his wages by half past nine.
Now he's bought a gramophone on the never never
And the tally man's gotta have his money on time
But the kids are jumping round
And they're wearing out their leather
Driving all the neighbours out of their minds
Make a noise with boys and girls of the nation
That's the explanation of the U.K. Jive.

Blow in my ear, I like the way you do that.
And that's what I wanna hear.
Is that a fact?
Are you jiving me?
Oh, you bad pussy cat
You'll make papa mad.

Do that U.K. Jive
Do that U.K. Jive
U.K O.K. U.K. O.K.
Do that U.K. Jive
[Repeat]

_SOT Now And Then _EOT
 
In the beginning of it all there was the land
And the sea and she sky
Then into the middle of it all there came man
To live on the land.
And then a great nation
Put into operation an evolutionary plan
Now mighty corporations and politicians rule the land
Wish I could remember when
We were more innocent
Than all of those violent bitter men.
The world was much younger then
But we were much wiser then.
Before we were full of discontent.
It's too bad the simple ways came sadly to an end
I guess that's the difference between now and then.
In the beginning of it all there was the land.
We were much younger then
But we were much wiser then
We never questioned why or when
One day we'll be born again
Our lovers and friends will remain
To live in a world without suffering and pain
And I can see a day when enemies are friends.
And there'll be no distance between now and then.
In the beginning of it all there was the Land.

_SOT What Are We Doing _EOT
 
What am I doing in a place like this
When it's painfully clear that my face don't fit?
What am I doing acting identikit,
When all I want to do is to be the opposite?
Why am I, why are you,
Who's pretending just who's fooling who
Do we go our way or join in their merry queue.
What are we doing in the pouring rain
Walking hand in hand, I gotta be out of my brain.
What are we doing, is it all for show
Are we drifting along, going along with the flow.
I don't know, I wish I knew
Is it me or you who's fooling
What a bore, where's the door
Are we just for decoration?
What am I doing to you?
What are you doing to me too?
What are they doing to us?
Someone help me, tell me truly.
What are we doing in a place like this
Trying to prove to the world that we really exist
Standing around with all the egotists
Sticking out like a zit knickers all in a twist.
Why are we?  I don't know,
Are we merely going with the flow
To prove, who we know
Or drifting along acting a part in a show?
Why am I going through this?
Why are you going through this too?
What are they doing to us?
Someone help me, tell me truly.

So do we go our own way
Or do we join their merry queue
Pretending it's O.K.
Them or us, who's fooling who?

Why are we standing in the acid rain
Watching industrial waste trickling down the drain?
What are we doing under the nuclear glow
What we all gonna do?  Where we all gonna go?
What are we doing?
What are we doing?

_SOT Entertainment _EOT
 
There's been another assassination
T.V. cameras moving in.
To shoot the bloodstains on the pavement
And get them on the News at Ten.
Will he live or will he die, before we go on the air?
Yes, the networks are all there, in the name of
Entertainment.

Superstar psycho, from a killer to a hero,
An overnight sensation on the lips of all the nation
Is he mad or is he sane?  It makes for good conversation
I call it suffering and pain, but they call it entertainment

Sex violence murder and rape. (Entertainment Entertainment)
That's what you came for, that's what you pay for.

Entertainment, Entertainment.

They call it Entertainment
Inform us, educate us with your media machine
(Call it Entertainment)
Tell me what to dream

You pay your money, what do you get?
Entertainment.

Real life for Entertainment,
Cheapens my reality,
So that Hollywood can make it into another "B" movie
The vultures get the rating and the people get the thrills
But the victims always pay, I guess they always will.

Sex violence murder and rape (Entertainment Entertainment)
That's what you want, that's what they need,
That's what you came for, that's what your paying for.

They call it Entertainment (Call it Entertainment)
Inform us, educate us with your media machine,

Tell me what to dream

_SOT War Is Over _EOT
 
Old soldiers talk about the battles fought
To build a better world for me and you.
They sacrificed their lives to make a dream come true.
Now they're forgotten men remembered by so few.

But the war is over and the fighting ended many years ago.
The war is over.  The battle's won but what is there to show?
Side by side they marched together fighting so their children
Could be free,
To build a better world, a new society
All classes unified to live in harmony

Now the war is over so let's forget and leave the past alone.
The war is over, it's time for all the soldiers to go home.

Rich men, poor men make history,
Fighting for the land of hope and glory
A nation's voice will sing as one,
A battle cry until we've won

The was is over and the patriotic comrades are no more.
The war is over
Now they're going home to live just like before.

Arm in arm we sang our patriotic songs of love and sentiment.
Tears of joy to hide the sorrow,
New tomorrows till we meet again,
With a new world to build we'll say auf weidersein.
What did they do for us?
What did it prove to us?
As we stand beside the silent grave
The unknown soldier can't be saved.

The war is over
The war is over, it's time for all the soldiers to go home.
The war is over.

_SOT Down All The Days (To 1992) _EOT
 
Down all the days
Though the past is just a blink away,
The future waits for me and you,
Down all the days to 1992

Here is hope for all the people
And generations yet to come,
An the future's bright tomorrow,
Illuminated by the morning sun.
Here's for all the working people
And me the ordinary man
For assembly workers in the factory
For farmers toiling on the land

Down all the days
All nations will unite as one
A new horizon clear to view
Down all the days to 1992

So lonely on this island ever since she set me free.
Breaking out of my isolation
Reaching out with hands across the sea
Down all the days, down all the days

Hello my Celt and Gaelic ladies.
Bonsoir my green colleen from Ireland
Wilkommen Deutch and Dutch and Dansk
Gutten tag amour prego ola combien

I'm losing all my bitterness
It's time to find some happiness
Around the earth, the sky, the sea
Down all the days

Bon soir, my little senorita, c'est magnifique
Au revoir, my little fraulfin baby, it's so tragique
Achtung parlez vous Englese, bon appetit
Jawohl, mambo Italiano, ca va, O.K. I'm on my way
Down all the days.

Can we heal the wounds of many wars?
And the battle scars that went before
Down all the days to 1992
There's gonna be a celebration in 1992
Somehow we lost communication
But I'll find you girl and come back home to you
Down all the days
There's gonna be a celebration in 1992
Somehow we lost communication
I'll find you girl and come back home to you
Down all the days.
Around the earth, the sky, the sea, down all the days
Around the earth, the sky, the sea, down all the days

_SOT Loony Balloon _EOT
 
The world's spinning round like a looney balloon
Heading for a collision with Saturn and Mars
And we're narrowly missing the man in the moon,
Spinning out of control crashing into the stars.
Have we all lost our gravity, reason and sanity?
Is this the price that we pay?
Have we now lost our way on this looney balloon?

Drift away, just drift away.
It's so easy to just drift away.
Drift away, just drift away.
Drifting away on this looney balloon.

The air is running out, the computer's gone down.
The mechanic just panicked, he's nowhere to be found.
So automatic control is just spinning us round
No point screaming in space, you just can't hear a sound.
Now the pilot's gone mad, he just jumped overboard
With a lunatic smile on his face
And he laughed as he cut the umbilical chord
Now he's drifting forever in space.

Drift away, just drift away.
It's so easy to just drift away.
Drift away, just drift away
Drifting away on this looney balloon.
We're out of control on this looney balloon
Narrowly missing the planets and stars.
Even optimists say that it's all gloom and doom.
We've got to get somewhere or hit something soon.
First class and economy, we all played the game
For selfish profit and gain.
So together we'll all go insane on this looney balloon.

Drift away, hey, just drift away,
Drifting away on this looney balloon.
Drift away, hey, just drift away.
Drifting away on this looney balloon.
Drift away, hey,
Drift away.  Drift away.

_SOT Dear Margaret _EOT
 
Dear Margaret I beg of you
Dear Margaret gonna tell on you
Don't want to be patronized
By those lying eyes
Dear Margaret I wanted you

You're warming me up
So you can leave me cold
Kissin' up to the rich
Intending to control
All the money money money
Is that all you live for
You're a model and example
Of a greed that will destroy

Dear Margaret I beg of you
Don't you like Rock 'n' Roll
Dear Margaret gonna tell on you
I like your wiggle when you walk
Dear Margaret I trusted you
Don't you let me down
Dear Margaret I wanted you

You had me living the illusion
To be a millionaire
Investing in stocks
Look at you now stringin' other guys along
You're into swinging
Now the money is all gone

Dear Margaret I beg of you
Don't you like Rock 'n' Roll
Dear Margaret I trusted you

Your economic growth
And your cool suntan
But what have you done to your fellow man
You've betrated us all with just a
Wave of your hand
What good is prosperity
When it starves the soul in man

Dear Margaret I beg of you
Don't you like Rock 'n' Roll
Dear Margaret gonna tell on you
I like your wiggle when you walk

Don't want to be patronized
By those lying eyes
Dear Margaret I trusted you
Don't you let me down
Dear Margaret I wanted you

_SOT Bright Lights _EOT
 
Time's running out just as fast as it can
She's leaving me cold
I don't understand
Hearts beating hard on the edge of the floor
Gotta kill this pain 'cause I can't take no more

Bright Lights on a cold night
If it feels good then it's alright

Thinking about when we first met
All these memories kill me
Get them out of my head
The flashing lights of the cities roar
Make my mind a blurr
Who's knocking on the door
Nothing's for keeps
Can't get no sleep
My future is late
Guess I'll find it next week

Bright Lights on a cold night
If it feels good then it's alright
She's caught up in the spotlight

See her up there in a New York fashion show
See the freedom in her eyes
Could've chose a better time
For it all to go wrong

Another night and my life is my own
But it scares me half to death
Out in the bars in the village with friends
You can buy me a drink
But please don't mention her name

Bright Lights on a cold night
She's up there in the spotlight
Now it's over and it's goodnight

Bright Lights [3x]

See her up there in a New York fashion show
See the freedom in her eyes
Could've chose a better time
For it all to go wrong

Bright Lights on a cold night
If it feels good then it's alright

Bright Lights [2x]

_SOT Perfect Strangers _EOT
 
Everytime we meet
My heart skips a beat
Seems we're Perfect Strangers

I can't understand
What's inside of man
That makes us Perfect Strangers

Through all this time so lonely
All the people with nobody
With lifes misunderstanding
Feel I've known you all my life
There's something quite familiar in your eyes
A soul is calling
Do you ever wonder why?

Everytime we meet
A sympathetic beat
In the heart of strangers
Here the love it calls
But you don't know me at all
Seems we're Perfect Strangers
Just like Perfect Strangers

Ever looked up to the sky
On a night so melancholy
See the angry world around you
Really need someone to talk to
Doesn't mind you feel so crazy
Where's the understanding stranger
Or the understanding lover

I know there'll come a day
When peace will touch the heart of you
Until then I will say

Open up your eyes
You're not hypnotised
We're not really strangers
You don't understand
That in the heart of love
There's no Perfect Strangers
Everytime we meet
A sympathetic beat
In the heart of strangers

[Repeats]

_SOT Wall Of Fire _EOT
 
Standing at the end of the horizon
Looking at another setting sun
Nature gave us all these toys to play with
But we've abused them, each and every one
They stretched the chord, snapped the wire
Lit the fuse but can't retire
We're going to the wall of fire
Tip-toeing on the great high wire
Let's have a real fire

The city slickers built the great illusion
Now they're the first to crumble in the sun
Now we're going through the wall
Let's see the flames before we fall
We're going through the wall of fire
Let's have a real fire
Tip-toeing on the great high wire
Through the wall of fire

We drove on many rocky roads together
Through the storms and hurricanes we rode
Unified so no one could destroy us
We stretched the bounds
But always kept the code
Liberals shout and cause concern
Forget next week while we all burn
Let's run right through the wall of fire
Let's have a real fire
Death-defying while the flames grow higher
Through the wall of fire
Let's go through the wall of fire
Running through the wall of fire

_SOT Drift Away _EOT
 
Drift away, just drift away
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away
They say there's gonna be a river of blood
It's apocalypse now
So we're waiting for the flood
The ice is gonna melt, the water gonna rise
And we'll all go to hell
So they're keeping us advised
While the dollar falls down
The yen gonna climb
It's a moral decline
And I'm losing my mind
I think I'll just drift away
To that island of my dreams
Live in total fantasy
Close my eyes and drift away

Back in the real world
There's tension everywhere
And the smell of fear
Keeps hanging around and polluting the air
The man on the news is going over the top
Now he'll say anything so his show don't flop
Wall Street's down, so what
And according to astute market analysis
The world's gonna stop
They shout the story to the nation
Pass on the panic to the population
This is the end of civilization
It's all over now

[Chorus:]
Meanwhile, I just drift away
To my island in the sun
Imaginary paradise, perfection
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away
Drift away (drift away)
Drift away (drift away)
Drift away (drift away)

Now all the politicians are running out of hope
They've burned all their bridges
Now they just can't cope
And who do we blame now we're all going broke?
It's that man over there
Who's hanging from a rope
Newsmen winding up the nation
A little bad news helps circulation
Pass on the panic to the population
It's all over, it's all over
It's all over now

Times like this, I just drift away
To my tropical fantasy
Living on coconuts growing on the trees
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away
Drift away, drift away, drift away
It's apocalypse now, drift away
Rivers of blood, drift away
And the man on the news is going over the top

[Chorus]

_SOT Still Searching _EOT
 
I'm a drifter who has lost his way
And I'm still searching for my dream
A wandering nomad with no home to stay
Just like a gypsy or a refugee
Lookin' at another sign for another town
Wondering if I'm ever gonna settle down
Or am I gonna keep on searchin' till my dying day

[Chorus:]
Still searching, still searching, still lookin', all alone
Till I find myself a home
Still searching, still searching, just like a rolling stone
Destination still unknown
When all my energy starts letting me down
I get this feeling I'll be still wandering 'round
Still searching, still workin', still lookin'
Until I find a way

This world is full of restless souls
Sleeping rough and living day to day
Drifters who left families wondering why they went away
Perhaps that's how I wanna be
While I'm looking for some peace of mind
How can I find security?
A restless spirit who can't reach his goal
Can't find a home until I've found my soul
Still hitchin' rides and lookin' for a place to go

[Chorus]

Still searching, still searching, still searching
Until my dying day, oh yeah
Why? yeah
Surprise, surprise
Still searching, still workin', still lookin'
Until I find my way
I'm a drifter who has lost his way
And I'm still searching for my dream

Everybody gotta fatal flaw
Everybody got something to hide
Take a look into my eyes
See the fear and silent cries - phobia
Deep inside, take another look at it - phobia
Everybody got a phobia
Take another look, what you got - phobia
There are alleyways of your psyche
That have gotta be analyzed
Psychological penetration
Of the fear you cannot hide
There's a key to a door to be opened
And I wanna take a look inside
And in the darkest shadow of your mind
What you gonna find?
Phobia

Out under a technicolor ray
It all disappears on a bright, sunny day
But even on a crowded street
Somebody you might meet
Might trigger a repeat of phobia
Strikes again, fear of fire and being buried alive
Dizzy heights, wire coat hangers
Things that crawl and go bump in the night - phobia
Fear of germs
Creepy crawlies that make you squirm - phobia
Images of long ago, memories that you hardly know
A minor childhood incident
Triggering something deep below
Spiders' webs and black cats
Cockroaches and sewer rats
Full moons and witches hats
Creepy crawlies, vampire bats - phobia
I'm talking about phobia

Crowded rooms, too many faces
Suffocation, open spaces
Everybody gotta weird sensation
That they wanna keep trapped inside
Maybe it's a sexual deviation
Hiding beneath a respectable guise
If you are of this persuasion
There is just one explanation - phobia
Started out a long time ago - phobia
When you were small you may have seen a sight
But you were too young to know - phobia
What you got - phobia
Everybody got phobia, what you got - phobia
Everybody got phobia, take another look, what you got?
Everybody got phobia, what you got?

_SOT Only A Dream _EOT
 
Standing by the elevator
Feeling gloomy and down
Waiting for the flashing light
To lift me up from the ground
Then the elevator opened
And I saw her standing there
She had to be a young executive
She looked so corporate and clean
And I thought I'd seen her somewhere before
On the cover of a magazine
I didn't think she'd even look at me
Or bother to glance my way
But she actually smiled at me and said
Hi-ya handsome, have a good day

[Chorus:]
I must be dreaming if she looks at me
I gotta be dreaming, is it a fantasy
Now I've got positive emotions
Buzzing 'round every molecule in me
I gotta be dreaming, is it reality
But over and over I live that memory
Was it real or only a dream
La la la la

Was it my imagination playing tricks on me
When she looked my way
Maybe she took me for somebody else
Whatever it was, it made my day, hey hey

I wake up in the morning
Smiling with anticipation
Suddenly I feel alive
Face the world with expectation
I must be dreaming this world is a better place
Was my imagination playing tricks on me
Was it real or only a dream?
I see a great big sunset
Where only clouds used to be
Was it all an illusion, is it fantasy
If it's just a dream
It's good enough for me, yeah yeah

Waiting by the elevator
Feeling optimistic and keen
Waiting for my executive goddess
To appear as if in a dream
Then the elevator opened
She was talking to another guy
And I tried to say hello to her
But I failed to even catch her eye
Then everybody crowded inside
And I sadly stood my ground
Thinking life's just like that elevator
It takes you up and brings you down

[Chorus]

Was it only an illusion
Was it real or only a dream

[Chorus]

_SOT Don't _EOT
 
Walking 'round this metropolis
With its buildings that reach to the clouds
There must be millions of people out there
Walking 'round with their heads bowed
This city kills me, but it thrills me
Now something's gone and held up the crowd
They're pointing at a man standing high on a ledge
And somebody just cried out loud
Don't look down at the people below, oh
Don't look down
It's a long way to fall and I'd sure like to know
What made it happen, sure makes you think
Must have been something special
To send him to the brink
Down here on the sidewalk, he's clearly in view
Then a voice shouts up to him
Try thinking it through but whatever you do

[Chorus:]
Don't look down
At the people below, oh
Don't look down, things might start looking up
You just never know

He's heard the cries of the lunatics facing defeat
The cheers of the winners
Who are dancing in the street
Perhaps the crime and corruption finally got through
And the violence of the city
Just broke him in two
Now a voice from the queue shouts

[Chorus]

Don't look down, don't look down
Down here on the sidewalk
It's stopped all our lives
People are talking instead of just walking by
Before this happened it was just another day
Now people are talking instead of walking away
Now we're gripped by this tragedy
Our blood starts to pump as we all shout together
Don't jump, don't jump

[Chorus]

Don't look down, we all shouted out, oh
Don't look down
It's a long way to fall and I'd sure like to know
What made it happen, guess we'll never know
Now the sun's come out
Looks like he's standing on a rainbow
He's in the heavens, I'm standing on the ground
Saying don't look down

_SOT Babies _EOT
 
Babies being born every day
In a world where there's so much to discover
All the babies crying out from the womb
Not much room, can I come out mother?

Mama, can you hear me call?
Don't drop me now
'Cos it's a long way to fall
Mama, I can hear all the sounds
Outside it's like a battleground
And I'm afraid to fall down
Into the great big nowhere
Papa's had a skin full of beer
Mama, don't let him into here
Baby, baby

Babies being born
Different hormones and genes
There's so many of us out there
How was I conceived
Was it love, was I meant
Or was I just an accident

Mama, what I sense from outside
It's a world full of fear
And there's nowhere to hide
Mama, I feel safe between these walls
And I'm so scared of heights
And it's a long way to fall
Into the great big nowhere
Maybe Papa's getting pressure from his peers
Are you straight, are you queer
So he made me, baby

Babies being born, some are rich, some are poor
But they're innocent and unprepared
Little girls and boys, didn't ask to be born
But they're always popping out there
Falling into the great big nowhere

Mama, I know that once upon a time
You and Papa were rich
When you were both in your prime
Mama, now you got the pains
And I know it's nearly time
But I don't want to join the crowd
I see standing in line
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Babies being induced, no excuse, what's the use
So they're always popping out there
Babies didn't wanna be born
Ill equipped, running loose
But they're innocent and unprepared

Mama, now you are showing all the signs
But is your world upside-down
On its head just like mine
Mama, now your ambition is mine
Don't make me over
Achieve too much in my time
Oh Mama, please don't make me climb
Mama

_SOT Over The Edge _EOT
 
Everybody is a victim of society
Comedy, tragedy, vaudeville and variety
Pantomime players in the grand tradition
Winners and losers till the intermission

Girl, I know the world's a stage
That's what the poet said
But I think our weird relationship
Is way above my head
I'll be your Casanova whipping by
If that's what you desire
But once I start performing
I can't easily retire

I'll swing on a trapeze
I'll jump through hoops
And I'll eat fire
Be a human cannon ball
And walk on the high wire
Put on make-up, wear a wig
I'll be your tragic clown
But once you've got me up there
I can't easily come down

Don't drive me over the edge of it
Can't you see I've got mixed-up emotions
Joined the crowd just to be part of it
That was the start of it
Oh, now I'm over the edge
(Don't drive me over the edge of it)
Oh, over the edge

The world is turning upside-down
Civilization's dead, over the edge
Economic turmoil, now the world is in the red
Democracy's a shadow of its former glory
Law and orders broken-down
End of story

My next door neighbour's totally snapped
He's gone over the edge
He's putting up barbed wire barricades
Around the garden hedge
And planting land mines on the lawn
He's gone barmy
According to his wife, he's formed a secret army
Ever since he got laid off
Something inside snapped
His wife says he's gone 'round the twist
Now there's no turning back
All night he waits in the garden shed
For the enemy to attack
A suburban vigilante
Dressed up in a union jack
He's over the edge, oh, over the edge

Don't drive me over the edge of it
Woman, you are gonna drive me
Totally over the edge
Is it yes or is it no
Are you gonna take the pledge
The pressures of society are getting to your brain
And forced you to act weird
And put me under all this strain
But don't drive me over the edge of it
Stop while I've still got emotions
Joined the crowd, just to be part of it
That was the start of it
Oh, over the edge
Don't drive me over the edge of it

Everybody is a victim of society
Comedy, tragedy
Vaudeville, variety
Pantomime players in the grand tradition
Forced into roles that leave them totally driven
Right over the edge

_SOT Surviving _EOT
 
Look at us here today
Lots of talking with nothing to say
And if I seem somewhat vague
It's because I'm somewhat afraid
I'm surviving, that's all I am
I'm surviving to be a better man
I'm surviving, that's my plan
Just surviving

Yesterday, I was sure
But today I don't know anymore
Thought I was brave till I saw
My frightened reflection in a dark corridor
Now I'm surviving to be a better man
I'm surviving with an emotional plan
I'm surviving, so please understand
I'm surviving, surviving

There are millions of people out there
Trying to get by in a world that don't care
People smiling through clouds of despair
Protecting the wounds until they repair
They're surviving the best way they can
They are surviving every woman and man
Just surviving with an emotion plan
So keep surviving

Maybe it's my shattered pride
That's why I get scared of emotional ties
Don't let them in, otherwise
You'll smile like a fool
But you'll be hurting inside
So I'm surviving through the insecurity
I am surviving, I got hope inside of me
So I'm smiling through all the insanity
I'm surviving, surviving

I was moved by the way that you said
Don't be afraid, I won't leave you for dead
You took my soul and mixed up my head
You left me alive
You should have killed me instead
Now I'm surviving, that's all I am
I'm surviving to be a better man
I'm surviving, that's my plan
I'm surviving, surviving
Surviving

_SOT It's Alright (Don't Think About It) _EOT
 
They want your mind and your body
But they don't understand
And don't care much about it
Gotta work for your country
Society's built on concrete and money
If this room was to vanish
And the toys of man turned to civilized dust
There'd still be you and me, honey
With our history gone
But the spirit lives on

Build those highways, build those cars
On a planet full of scrap metal
There'd better be life on Mars

[Chorus:]
It's alright, it's alright
If you don't think about it
It's alright
If you don't look at it, it's alright

How time slips away
Live by the Good Book
That's what the wise men say
But where does it leave us
Were they right or were they wrong
Gotta have hope, gotta carry on

It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

They want your soul and your spirit
Make them understand
These things they never can have
Gotta work for your family
A community built on trust, not money
If this town was to vanish
And the office blocks were just turned into ashes
They'd be you and me, honey
With the will to survive
And the spirit lives on

Build those factories
Plants and cars
On a planet so desecrated
There'd better be life on Mars

[Chorus]

How time slips away
Live by the Good Book
That's what the wise men say
But where does it leave us
Were they right or were they wrong
Gotta have hope
Gotta carry on

It's alright, it's alright

_SOT The Informer _EOT
 
Isn't it strange meeting you here
Two old friends
Just sitting down quietly drinking a beer
But knowing your past the way that I do
After all this time I'm surprised
You'd even come to this rendezvous

They say you went and moved across the border
So it's hard to believe
That you're sitting here with me tonight
I know you're on the run, you shouldn't be here
But do you feel the fear
When you meet an old friend and the enemy's near

It's strange we always go to church on Sundays
After getting right out of it on a Saturday night
And if we stay here too long, I know that we'll quarrel
And end up having a fight
Just a couple of losers putting the world to right

Just two people having a beer
But on either side there is so much anger
And so much fear
Just two people trying to get by
But we're torn apart
Because of different pressures
From different sides

I hear you're on the run from law and order
But you had to show up
'Cos you knew it was a matter of pride
But beliefs aside, religion apart
Did you ever think about all the suffering you caused
And all the broken hearts?

The word is out that you are the informer
Who gave me away without so much as a fight
So be a good friend
And let me take you quietly without a fight
I'll be the one who's
Gonna take you home tonight
I'll be the one who's
Gonna take you home tonight

_SOT Hatred (A Duet) _EOT
 
You keep on accusing me
Of making your life misery
But if that's not abusing me, what isn't
You wanna be my friend, well it's too late
My love for you has turned to hate
And I think that it's a permanent condition
You say you wanna make the peace
Smile and turn the other cheek
I can't put myself in such a weak position
Now I'm willing to accept this fate
You and me just can't cohabitate
We agree to hate and that's our fast decision

Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that keeps us together
Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that lasts forever

Driven by hate, driven by hate
Driven by hate, driven by hate
ON the surface I'm a mild-mannered person
That's until you scratch the animal inside
Then you bring out all my animal aggression
I gotta hatred for you that is never gonna die
Driven to hate, driven to hate
Driven to hate, driven to hate

[Chorus:]
Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that lasts forever
Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that keeps us together

While races try to integrate
Nations try to gravitate
Towards equal rights, regardless of religion
Politicians might decree
For the sake of humanity
Love and peace instead of a collision
You and me accept reality
There's no way that we can agree
The world can't make us alter this position
At least you and I know where we stand
We can't be friends, walk hand in hand
My hostility for you defies description

Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that keeps us together
Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that lasts forever

Driven by hate, driven by hate
Driven by hate, driven by hate
Hate's the only thing we have in common
There's no escape, we'll always be this way
So we might as well just learn to live together
'Cos we're gonna be this way till our dying day
Driven by hate, driven by hate
Driven by hate, driven by hate

[Chorus]

If you keep on putting me down
Rub my name into the ground
I'll drag the dirt all over town about you
And if you spread the filth on me
I'll only have one remedy
I'll spill the beans, you'll see I've got a mouth, too

[Chorus 2x]

Yeah, hatred
Your attitude is downright rude
Your jokes appall me, they're so crude
Why don't you just drop dead and don't recover
I'm the mirror to your mood
You hate me and I hate you
So at least we understand each other
Hatred, hatred is the only thing that lasts, what is it?
Hatred, hatred

Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that lasts forever
Hatred, hatred
Is the only thing that lasts forever

_SOT Somebody Stole My Car _EOT
 
That's life in the big city
You beg for mercy but you got no pity
Low-life zero mentality
Vandalized victims of depravity
Fast food, take-out mentality
Where the dogs eat the dogs
And the innocent bleed
The city can't cope and the cops don't care
There's fear in the streets
It's a jungle out there
I don't want it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't want it

[Chorus:]
Somebody stole my car
Somebody stole my automobile
They ripped off the radio and sold the wheels
And if it's happened to you
Then you know how I feel
Somebody stole my car

Somebody stole my car
I left it parked outside of my home
It had a new A/C and a cellular phone
And I'm as sick as a dog
'Cos I'm still paying off the loan
Somebody stole my car

That's life in the metropolis
Living on credit and overdrawn interest
Craving commercialized commodities
Everything advertised, stirring up greed
Everyday I wonder why
Everyday I can't get away
The city's in debt, up past its ears
Yet we still borrow more
And pay it back next year
Now I'm paying for a car that I no longer own
And the next time anybody offers me a loan
I'll say I don't want it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't want it

Somebody stole my car
It's just been cleaned and I've just had it taxed
It had brand-new stereo speakers in the back
And I call up the cops
With a panic attack
Somebody stole my car

Somebody stole my car
I bet they're riding around and running red lights
Got chicks in the back and ballin' all night
While I sit at home
Getting more uptight
Somebody stole my car

[Chorus]

Don't want it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't want it
Somebody stole my car
Somebody stole my car
Somebody stole my car

That life in the metropolis
Possessions mean nothing in a world like this
Some punks wanna ride and they see my car
So they take it, shake it
Burn it up and break it
Hey, that's my car
Somebody stole my car

_SOT Close To The Wire _EOT
 
A hopeful adventure
Got missionary ways
Could start in the jungle
Feel this way
Search for an answer
Over land and over sea
All the mountains
Of promised opportunities

I cried out but you were lost
In a corporate position
So money's the solution
Curing all that ails the nation
But what about the hearts of man
The spiritual needs
I'm staring at the starlight
And I just can't quite believe
That I'm

[Chorus:]
Lost in the fire
So close to the wire
Got to survive
So close to the wire

The soul needs attention
Like the body needs to breath
But banks want investment
So who are we
Cultures are dying
But gold reserves are safe
Can't live in this jungle
But can't escape

Whatever happened
To the dreams we shared together
A taste of wine
A moonlight song that lasts forever

[Chorus]

Feel the expectation
Written in the ways
Each move of a man give away

You look good to me
Sat in your ministry position
An image for the masses
Making serious decisions
Talk about, sham about
For all the world to see
Your rhetoric's a quiz game
And a mystery to me

[Chorus]

So close to the wire

_SOT Scattered _EOT
 
This song is dedicated to the memory of
Annie Florence Davies and Carol Bryans.

Like a seed that is sewn
All the children are scattered
By a breeze that is blown
Now the crops are all scattered
We are torn, we are shattered
Now some of us are barmy and battered
And the fields where we gathered
Are overgrown in weeds and in tatters
Through it all we were scattered

To the fields we are scattered
From the day we are born
To grow wild and sleep rough
Till from the earth we are torn
And a soul that is free
Can live on eternally
And the spirit can live on
Though it's scattered in the world beyond
And I've been out of my mind
Ever since she's been gone

I look around that empty room
No sight nor sound
She's left so soon
She's out of view
But the I find
Those scattered clues she left behind
A photograph with a smiling face
A cigarette stubbed out on the fireplace
A coffee cup with her lipstick stains
I guess I'll never see her again

Now my life is all scattered
Ever since she's been gone
I feel older, I feel fatter
I feel the blues coming on
We get bruised
We get battered
But we'll pick up the pieces that scattered
And with emotional glue
We're gonna stick together, body and mind

Ever since she went away
I've been alone to contemplate
Time and space and why world's move
While sitting in my solitude
I've watched the stars and wondered why
They're scattered up there in the sky
And is she up there out of view
On some higher platitude

I wish I knew
Wish I could prove
The reason why this life on earth
Is scattered like the universe
I'm scattered here and scattered there
Bits of me scattered everywhere

To the fields we are scattered
Then from the dust we are born
We survive somewhat battered
To a new life, a new dawn
IN the end what will it matter
There'll only be my ashes to scatter
And all the logical answers
To a worrying mind
Will be scattered in time
Beaten and battered
To the earth you are scattered
You're going home so what does it matter
To an atomic mind
Scattered here while you travel time

_SOT Did Ya? _EOT
 
Went for a walk down the Old King's Road,
To see if anybody was there.
But there was nobody home at 3 Bywater Street,
And they had sold Cadogan Square.
And I remember myself in my tie dye sweater,
And my hipster corduroy flares.
As I knocked on doors,
And walked down one-way streets that led nowhere.

Ah, did ya ever think it wouldn't last forever?
Did ya ever think that it would get this bad?
Did ya ever think that everything would get so crazy?

Now the Chelsea Drug Store needs a fix,
It's in a state of ill repair.
And my Cuban heels are hurting my feet,
Just to add to my despair.
La-di-dahs drove Mini cars in the summertime.
(In the summertime)
Now they're towed away for parking on a double yellow line,
And they can't pay the fine.
(Did you ever think)
Did you ever think we'd all believe the hype?
(Did you ever think)
Did you ever think the classes all would revert back to type?
(Did you ever think)
Did you ever think the system ever really got it right?
Oh, baby.

They filled us full of false illusions and promiscuity,
And they led us down that class-less road to mediocrity.
As we walked down that alley way of hope,
We thought we'd found the motherload,
But we were led like lambs to that promise land,
With all the debts that we would owe.
Once trendies posed for tourist pictures in the summertime.
(In the summertime)
Not content with taking Polaroids, they purchased all the property that they could find,
And I've just sold mine.  (Did you ever!)

Did ya ever think that this green and plesant land,
(Did ya ever think)
Would end up in the bottom of some garbage can,
(Did ya ever think)
A dustbin full of promises and half-hearted plans.
Oh, baby.

Did ya, did ya, did ya ever think?
Did you ever think?
(In the summertime)

Now miseries and groaners moan and reminisce about the good old times and whine, whine, whine.
(Did ya ever think)
Did ya ever think when things were really fab,
(Did ya ever think)
That we'd be looking through a dustbin for a dog-end to drag,
(Did ya ever think)
And sleep on park benches wrapped in plastic bags.
Oh, baby.

Did ya ever think that it would get this crazy?
(Did ya ever think)
Did ya ever think that it would get this way?
(Did ya ever think)
Did ya ever think that we would pay the price for being lazy?

_SOT A Little Bit Of Sunlight _EOT
 
Tears would fall like the falling rain,
There would be a sea.
But you don't have to cry to prove your love,
Just believe in me.

'Cause a little bit of sunlight is all that I want from you,
A little bit of sunlight,
Is all that I want,
All that I want,
All that I want from you.

A man who can't live with cloudy skies,
Should only wait and see.
Soon all the clouds will disappear,
And leave just you and me.

'Cause a little bit of sunlight is all that I want from you,
A little bit of sunlight,
Is all that I want,
All that I want,
All that I want from you.

_SOT All Aboard _EOT
 
Come on pretty baby, don't play hide and seek with me.

_SOT All Night Stand _EOT
 
All night stand,
Been around seen a thousand places.
All night stand,
Seen a good half a million faces.

Because I've lived this life,
And I made it for myself.
If you scandalize my name,
Then you scandalize yourself.

Because I'm not to blame,
For the things that I've been doing.
You all say that I'm bad,
And I'll only end in ruin.

All night stand,
With a different girl each night.
All night stand,
With two hundred miles to ride.

But I won't give it up,
As long as I can make the bread.
When I do, I shall stop,
Close my eyes and go to bed.

And forget all this night[?],
And all the people on my back.
Once I'm free from these chains,
I ain't never looking back.

All night stand,
Been around seen a million faces, yeah.
All night stand,
Seen a good half a million places, yeah.

All night stand,
Can't get these people off my back.
All night stand,
Ten percent for this and that.

All night stand,
All night stand.

_SOT Americana _EOT
 
America, the land of the free, the home of the brave
That's what I thought before I toured there
You see, I've got myself being seduced by the sheer Americana of it all
And I'd seen their images on television
Of Lee Harvey Oswald, John F. Kennedy's assassination
And I thought "America is a violent place"
And America is keen to trap you
Like you had giant tentacles that wrapped themselves around you
Until you couldn't move and you were trapped
The land of the free, the home of the brave, guns and the Wild West

Hey big fat cowboy, wearing your big Stetson
Hey big fat cowboy, flashing your big six gun
Hey big fat cowboy, singing country & western
Hey big fat cowboy, is this the way that the West was won? Yeah

I found myself in the back of a big Ford Thunderbird
With a slick-looking dude
He looked like a punk from a B-movie,
The sort of punk that would piss everybody off
Until Lee Marvin put a bullet through his brain
The punk looked over at me
"Kinks? What kind of a motherfuckin' name is that?"
Then he reached over and picked up the car telephone
"Hey kid, I've got Elvis Presley's phone number.
I've got Ann-Margret's phone number. I've fucked Ann-Margret!"
I knew Mick Avory would be impressed with this, but I was not
And then the punk looked over at me
"I'll dial Elvis Presley" He dialed a number
"Hey, is that you Elvis? I wanna speak to the Colonel.
Jump to it, you mother!"
And then he looked over at me in a menacing way,
Reached into the glove-compartment and took out a revolver
He waved the six gun around, menacingly
"You see kid, when I deal with people, they have to treat me right,
Otherwise they contend with this! A gun!
Have you ever seen a gun before?"
I hadn't
Then he waved it around, put it back in the glove-compartment
"Welcome to Peoria, Illinois, home of Middle America,
Ice-cream and apple pie, guns and the Wild West"

All American wise guy, why achieve that gleam in the sun
Hamburger and a milkshake, all American dude
Popcorn and a t-bone, hot dog with a big smile
And a bad attitude, yeah yeah yeah

Flying across America on a TWA, flying to California
To appear on television, performing our new record Set me free
The Kinks were met by a union man with a contract to sign
And The Kinks didn't like signing contracts
"Hey, are you The Kinks? Sign this piece of paper guys!
I want you to sign this union-document so you can appear on television"
"No thanks mate, we don't wanna sign a contract"
"You have to sign, otherwise you cannot appear"
"We don't want to sign a piece of paper, alright!"
"Listen kid, you sign the piece of paper.
You with your red hunting jackets and your yellow frilly shirts.
Sign the piece of paper!"
"Do you wanna sign it?" He looked over at Dave
"Watcha gonna do kid?" "Fuck off!"
Which is a fairly reasonable thing to say in the circumstances,
But not very wise, you see, the man was a union executive
"Alright. Once I file my report on you guys
You're never gonna work in America again.
You're gonna find out just how powerful it is in America!"
The land of ice-cream and apple pie, guns and the Wild West

Great American union rules with the fist, a smile and a gun
Great American napalm lights up the sky like the sun
Great American eagle swoops down from the sky up above

And I remember the images of Lee Harvey Oswald
Appearing on TV saying he was a patsy
A union man is a-framin' The Kinks
While I thought "This is the land of opportunity"
But the Cosa Nostra are everywhere
Land of ice-cream and apple pie

Hey big fat cowboy, wearing that big six gun
Hey big fat cowboy, singing country & western
Hey big fat cowboy, moving that big six gun
Hey big fat cowboy, is this the way that the West was won?
Yeah yeah yeah

And 6 weeks later Robert and Grenville and Larry
Were sitting in their office in Carnaby Street
And the letter came from the American government
It was from the American Federation of Musicians Union
"A band known as The Kinks,
The English beat group known as The Kinks,
Are banned from America.
Their license to perform has been revoked indefinitely"
Yeah, all the same fuck off
In the land of the ice-cream and apple pie, guns and the Wild West

_SOT And I Will Love You _EOT

Not far away where the Sun always shines.
You will be mine,

Church bells will chime,

The finest moments in my life,

_SOT Animal _EOT
 
On reflection, it was not all wine on the wall
It was not all cuts and bruises
Or the pulling out of hair
And the bloodying of nose
And the tearing off of clothes, although

It was really animal, truly animal
There were times when there was absolute compassion in the air
Though it was really animal, truly animal

It could not compare to times we cared
And were in control and less emotional

While the intellect controls the spiritual
The animal respects what's natural
Ying and yang control man's actions
And both extremes are a natural reaction

It was really animal, truly animal,
Well there were times when there was absolute compassion in the air

On reflection it was not all crash and bang
Broken bottles and abuse
Sometimes there were sunsets on the sands
Holding onto caring hands
But there were vampire fangs
As the angels sang
It was ying and yang, oh yeah

It was truly natural, though it was really animal
In a sense it fell into a truly natural romance

Oh yeah,
It was really animal, truly animal
There were times when there was absolute compassion in the air

True love, true love, true love is really animal

_SOT Are You Ready Girl? _EOT
 
Well in this new love that you've found,

Though it's fun you talk about[?],
It's the night life you explore.
And are you ready girl?
Are you ready?

'Cause you're living with a man
Who will find no understanding.
Do you mind if I layed down and cried?
Do you ever know the way,
That I feel for you each day?
So are you ready girl?

He'll buy your time, he'll buy you sin.[?]
So are you ready girl?

He'll keep you laughing for a while,
Then he'll leave you with a smile.
So are you ready girl?
Are you ready?

'Cause you're living with a man
Who will find no understanding.
Do you mind if I layed down and cried?
Do you ever know the way,

_SOT Berkeley Mews _EOT
 
The leaves of brown came falling through you,
Berkeley Mews, I first met you,
I staggered through your chilly dining room,
Berkeley Mews, I first met you.

Your kitchen sink was cluttered up,
So I couldn't shut it up for longing
I brewed another cuppa up
And tried to sneak out early in the morning.

I thought you had much better things to do,
Berkeley Mews, I first met you,
Drowned my conversation with champagne,
Berkeley Mews, was not listening.

I thought you were an intellect,
But now that I reflect, you left me reeling.
You made me drink a toast
And when you finished I was looking at the ceiling.

The flood of tears I've wept thinking of you,
Remind me of that night in Berkeley Mews.
You know that you left me broken hearted,
Berkeley Mews.

_SOT Climb Your Wall _EOT
 
One time I saw you in the street
Thought that I would be that kind you want
Ooh babe, you're the best of them all

I'm trying to tell you how much I love you
Oh baby, please let me climb your wall
Ooh baby, you're the best of them all

Then in the dawn I'll be leavin'

Ooh babe, that's the strength of it all

Come on over, and see [?]

_SOT Did You See His Name? _EOT
 
Did you see his name in the local paper,
Stole a tin of beans,
From a cut-priced grocery store.
The judge said he must pay,
So he put him on probation,
And the paper gave his name.

Did you see his name in the criminal section,
And the center page.
Gave his name and his address,
They stopped him doing it again,
So they put him to dishonour,
And put the man to shame.

He lost his little job,
His employer was absolved of blame.
His world just crumbled down,
Incidently, did you see his name,
In the obiturary column,
Letters edged in black.
Life was much too hard to live,
So he brought it to an end,
In his gas-filled maisonette.
Because he couldn't stand the strain.

La-la-la-la-la
Life was much too hard to live,
So he brought it to an end,
In his gas-filled maisonette.

If you're worrying 'bout a rest,
And you can't get it off your chest,
Just lie down and try to ease your mind.

If your mother comes 'round the bend,
Come to give you a helping hand,
Do you wish to go and bury your head in the sand?

If you hide behind that door,
If you hide behind the troubles in your life.

You haven't got a friend,
And there's no one to take you in,
Will you come in, stretch and stand up on your own?

When you know that your time has come,
And there'll be no place to run,
There will be no time to bury your head in the sand.

So, do you wish to be a man?

Do you wish to be the one to understand?

Mister, won't you sing me a song,
Won't you sing a little melody.
Won't you try to help me along,
Won't you sing a little song for me, oh yeah.

Sing me a song or two,
Won't take you long to just sing to me please,
Won't you whistle a tune.

Though I ain't got a beanie
'Cause I've nothing to dream,
So if you waiting for nothing,
Do something for me.

Sing Mr. Songbird,

You help to keep the devil away.

_SOT My Diary _EOT
 
I looked in my diary, no spaces today,
A life so eventful, stacked with appointments too important to break,
Lunch at the bistro, tea at the Savoy cafe,
No time to contemplate the isolation,
No second can be wasted, no space to think because,
My diary is full but my life is empty.
Oh yes, my diary is full but my life is empty.

It's all so contemporary, the sheer pretension of it,
It's all so temporary, but all so shallow really,
Let me look, I might be able to squeeze you in between,
No, my diary is so full I couldn't possibly meet you today,
This evening is blocked out with potential investors in my lonely one-man play,
Perhaps next week maybe when there are fewer functions to attend,
So for now I'll pencil you in,
Between the visit to my doctor, my appointment at the bank,
This time it's really crucial, that's why it's written in red,
My diary is my life and my life is standing on my head,
Oh my diary is full but my life is empty,
Oh yes my diary is full but my life...

I look at your picture on my bedroom wall,
I'm trying to forget you, that's why my diary is so full,
Chock-a-block with engagements but it's only for show,
'Cause I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go,
To stop my isolation, keep myself occupied,
My diary is my one salvation,
Names, dates, numbers, but inside I long to cancel all those entries,
My diary is full but my life's empty,
My diary is full but my life is empty.

_SOT New World _EOT
 
Ein, zwei, drei, vier
I wake up in the morning
Looking at the street below.
Oh, the aggravation down below.
It's no coincidence at all.
The war is over,
But the battle has just begun.
It's still going on,
Still going on.
Why?

Mass migration of people,
Lithuania, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Refugees from all over the European continent.
All traveling to America,
The land of the free.
All traveling to America,
To the great city.
Life in the city
Started to get me down.
Everybody pushin' and shovin',
Aggravation all around.
Aggravation.
C'mon
C'mon

Oh baby

Have you had enough?
Have you had enough of all this aggravation?
Fifty years ago this year,
It was fifty years ago this year,
When the aggravation begun.
It's still going on.

_SOT Nobody's Fool _EOT
 
From the bright busy streets of the Charing Cross Road
To the dark little alleys in old Soho
From the smart noisy clubs where everybody goes
To the dark little streets that nobody knows

I couldn't care if the people don't notice me
They wouldn't know that I really exist
I'm nobody's shelter, I'm nobody's cover
I'm nobody's lover, and nobody's friend

I'm so use to lying and pretending
I'm nobody's fool and I'm nobody's friend

I can go for a walk on a crowded street
And see millions of faces staring at me
Some of them smiling, some of them glare
But most of them don't even know that I'm there

That's how I want to be 'cause no one belongs to me
I'm nobody's fool and I'm nobody's friend
Nobody pleads for me, nobody bleeds for me
I'm nobody's fool and I'm nobody's friend

I'm so use to lying and pretending
I'm nobody's fool and I'm nobody's friend

It seems a better life beginning
And all the mist will clear

'Cause the sun is gonna shine
And keep shining all the time
Oh yes, today, girl
Oh what a day it's gonna be

We'll remember things we're doing

Taken on a holiday when you were just three,

Yet you're such a little baby.
Chewing on your liquorish gum, and cigarettes.

_SOT Sand On My Shoes _EOT
 
As I sit by the sea
Drink tequila by the shade of a tree
There's a seniorita sat on my knee
Sprinkling sand all over me

I've got sand on my shoes
I've lost everything that I'm gonna lose
I've got nothing but the sun and the moon
And the sand that's on the beach

I am happy though my shoes are tattered and torn
Because the sea is so shiney
Ba ba-um-ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-um-ba

Thought I was civilized
Till I saw the sea and I realized
That the city life was just not for me
Left my troubles behind me

I've got nothing else that I'm gonna lose
I've got nothing but the sun and the moon

_SOT The Million-Pound-Semi-Detached _EOT
 
Haven't we come a long way
From newly-weds in our bed-sitter flat?
We skimped and scraped every penny
For a down payment on our semi-detached.
New towns for all the young hopefuls,
A garden suburb with mortgage attached,
Oh, look at us now, sale all agreed, now it's time to exchange the contracts
With the people who sold us a million-pound semi.

Straight out of national service,
Demob suits and short back and sides,
And saw the bomb sites turned air-raid shelters,
Where their families lived all of their lives.
Then the nation built them a utopia,
With pebbledash on the outside, oh,
Look at them now, they've come a long way, they are affluent and bursting with pride.
Soon we'll be sitting inside that million-pound semi-detached,
Detached, in our million-pound semi-detached.
Looking back at the past of this million-pound semi.

Two up two down, a back garden, that was the dream,
Two kids, a cat and a dog, that was the scheme.
Then the kids both grew up and got married and moved out of home,
Then we were strangers again, together alone.
Look at us now, what are we like,
Sitting alone in our million-pound semi-detached?

They're all taking early retirement, the sum total of all of their lives.
Now the country is fat with inflation, immigration has helped us survive.
Once an Englishman's home was his castle,
Now it's a freehold investment to buy, oh,
Look at us now, our debts are all paid, and the Empire has really struck back.
We're the proud owners of a one-million-pound semi-detached,
So detached in our million-pound semi-detached.
A new generation is buying and starting anew,
And learning by all their mistakes the way people do.
Like all the young hopefuls we're buying the future from you,
We hope that one day we'll understand what you've both been through.
Look at us now, what are we like,
Sitting alone, in our million-pound semi-detached?
Look at us now, what are we like,
Sitting alone, in our million-pound semi-detached?

_SOT The Road _EOT
 
Sitting alone on my hotel
Looking in the mirror wondering, "well,
After all this time you never thought you'd still be out on the road?"
Like a gypsy I was born to roam
Like a wanderer with no fixed abode
I think about the friends I've left behind on the road

Well, the road's been rocky along the way
It's been a long, hard haul on the motorway
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day

(On the road)
The bed and breakfasts and the greasy spoons
(The road)
The loser bars and the noisy rooms
(The road)
The casualties who did too many lines
(The road)
Wasted talent on women and wine

I think of all the friends I've left behind
Whenever it's time to get back out on the road

Started playing blues in a coffee bar
I took a trip down Charing Cross Road
With my imitation Gretsch guitar
And my head full of songs and my eyes full of stars
I saw a band called the Rolling Stones
I thought, "that's it, I'll get a band,
I'm leaving home, I'm out on the road."

The motorways all over this land
(The road)
Far away places like Wigan and Birmingham
(The road)
Didn't have no name, didn't have any fans
(The road)
Didn't have no money so we slept in the van

All those early gigs we ever played
Sometimes we were lucky if we even got paid
On the road
Pete played on the bass guitar
Liked to get around, mixing with all the stars
But Mrs. Avory's child was all fingers and thumbs
But solid as a rock, setting time on the drums
While Dave the Rave hit the rock 'n' roll riffs
Yours truly strummed away with a slightly limp wrist
On the road

Everyday is when I can't get used to it
Everyday is when I can't get away
Another day, another freeway to face
That's the road

Well, life is a road, it's a motorway
And the road gets rocky along the way
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day

(On the road)
Jimi Hendrix, The Who, the Led Zeppelin and Free
They took the road so it's alright by me
Some are survivors, some are debris
If you play in a band that's the road that you take
Living in it, eating in it, sleeping in it
You wake up in the morning, what do you see?
The road

Life is a road, it's a motorway
Lost a lot of good friends along the way
All the families and homes that I've left behind
To the wives and the lovers and friends who had their time
I say, "you take your road and I'll take mine."
(You take your road and I'll take mine)
You take your road and I'll take mine
(You take your road and I'll take mine)

Life is a road, it's a motorway
And the road gets rocky along the way
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day

(On the road)
Observed all the various phases from
Flower power, heavy metal and acid rock
And still all the critics keep saying
"Are they still around?  When they gonna stop?"
It's just the dedicated followers of fashion who like putting down
All the well respected men who came dancing and are still on the road

Sometime I get suicidal
Now everyone is a rival
Different cars, different bars and hotels
Corporations, big business and egos
When it all gets too bad I think back
When we were all each other had
When we started out on the road

And there's gas in my tank and I've still got a way to go
Another hotel, it's time to check out soon
As I look around the room
I think of all the friends I've left behind
On the road

_SOT The Shirt _EOT
 
As I walked into the charity store
I saw a second-hand shirt hangin' up by the door
The collar was frayed, there was a stain on the cuff
Caused by ketchup or blood or some such stuff
It wasn't made of polyester or nylon
The label said "Made in the UK" so I tried it on
And I looked in the mirror and declared
"I like this shirt, I want it"

It's not the label on the shirt that you wear
It's the way that you wear it
They say it's style and breeding and culture that counts
But you can't change good taste on the expense account
And if design or fashion makes you a hero
You can dress all highbrow but still be an emotional zero
But I declare "It's not the shirt you wear
It's the way that you wear it"

I was looking for danger, I should have taken more care
I was dressed to kill, I felt so debonair
Wild expectations, arrogant air
Then I walked into that bar, she was standing there
I walked over with all my savoir fair
And she said "You're a smart looking dude
But your character's ugly, it clashes with my shoes
And I, I can't stand your attitude"

I assumed it was leading to a romantic interlude
I thought my conquest was made
But I was stunned by the magnitude
Of her ingratitude
I spent a good thirty bucks on this babe
Like the shirt I was wearing

This romantic affair was not destined to last
The harder I tried, the louder she laughed
I was reduced to despair, my emotions laid bare
She knew I was hurt, made me feel like a jerk
I was humbled, humiliated, castrated
My masculinity dragged through the dirt
Then thrown in the air to be devoured by the lions
The vultures, the jackals and all the scavengers of love
I was strutting around with my chest stuck out
Like a peacock preparing to get laid
Thought I looked cool but she put me down
She said "You look like a clown on a circus parade"
Still the shirt has class, it looks well made
She was a babe of the first degree
She was totally fantabulous
Like a goddess from Greece and yet
The epitome of the 20th century femininity
She was in her own league
She was meant for me, it was destiny
Like Adam and Eve, synchronisity
She brought out the testosterone in me

Last time I saw that babe she was smiling contentedly
Now I'm trapped on this murder rap, a mistaken identity
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
Now this cop says "It's up to you, death row or solitude
Crime of passion, you should plead 'insane'
You say you wouldn't lie, but we've just blown your alibi
We've found your shirt and it's got a blood stain"

It was the shirt you were wearing
It was the shirt you were wearing

_SOT There's A New World Just Opening For Me _EOT
 
Now I know just what I've been doing wrong,
Life seems empty, but it won't last for long.
I shan't go on this way.
There's a new world just opening for me.

Been alive, but it could be lying down.  [?]
Just can't tell when the devil's on the prowl.
I can't pretend no more.
There's a new world just opening for me.
There's a new world just opening for me.

Win the battle, but the victory brings you pain.
You make confessions, but you do the same again.
I won't go on this way.
There's a new world just opening for me.
I won't go on this way.
There's a new world just opening for me.

_SOT This I Know _EOT
 
Like the clouds that bring the rain
Like the sun that makes the flowers
Like the soft and gentle breeze
I will blow away the showers

This I know, this I know and I know
I love you for the rest of my life
I can't wait till tomorrow comes
I can't wait to see the sunlight in your eyes
When you know that I am yours

I don't know what makes the stars
Light up the sky when nighttime's falling
But like the stars up in the sky
My love for you is everlasting

This I know, this I know and I know
I love you for the rest of my life
I can't wait till tomorrow comes
I can't wait to see the sunlight in your eyes
When you know that I am yours

When the leaves fall sadly down
When the autumn winds are blowing
They don't feel sad because they know
A new life comes at springtime's dawning

This I know, this I know and I know
I love you for the rest of my life
I love you for the rest of my life

_SOT Till Death Do Us Part _EOT
 
What can I do?
How can I show you,
And let you see,
That I am someone,
That you want me to be.

I'm only me,
Not someone better,
Not someone good.
I'd be a soldier,
That's if I only could.

If I were king,
I'd tell my army,
To change the world.
Then I'd be someone,
Like you want me to be.

In my little life,
I know that the world must keep on turning,
Even though it leaves me far behind.
Life is like a school,
But I'm not prepared to keep on learning,
Even though it treats me like a fool.

This is our lot,
To live together,
Not live apart.
Let's stay together,
Until death us do part.

Not just a day,
But till forever,
Just as the stars,
Just as the ending,
Until death us do part.

_SOT Time Will Tell _EOT
 
Time will tell if I will drift eternally,
Through life instead of being someone.
All of my life, you are the one, you're on my mind.
Have a good time, do what you want, but you will find,

Time will tell if I'll survive.
I'd rather be dead than just pretend I'm alive.
Time will tell, it's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.

Time will tell if we will be the same as now,
Or not, if not, then never mind.
All of my life, you are the one, you're on my mind.
Have a good time, do what you want, but you will find,

Time will tell if I'll survive.
I'd rather be dead than just pretend I'm alive.
Time will tell, it's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.

Time will tell if dreams become reality,
For you got me, as long as you want.
All of my life, you are the one, you're on my mind.
Have a good time, do what you want, but you will find,

Time will tell if I'll survive.
I'd rather be dead than just pretend I'm alive.
Time will tell, it's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.

_SOT To The Bone _EOT
 
In the back of a record rack
There's a old double pack
Twelve inches and black
With an old crumpled cover
But every track is stacked

And it takes me back
To the one who caused this melancholy mood
And every single groove
Cuts me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

I took her back to my bachelor flat
While the stereo played for two
She unwrapped her gift
And played me a riff
And said, "this old record was just made for you"

Then we danced to songs of passion and
The singer's velvet tones
On the gramaphone
While the record played
She rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone

Those those rock n' roll romantic songs
Played all summer long
And she rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone.

Yeah, she rocks me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

In dreams she's smiling in slow motion
Devouring all of my emotion
Angels singing rock 'n' roll
While demons take away my soul

Voices sound, her image fades
Every time that record plays
She rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone

In my back room there's an old 45
That we played all summer long
Shakin the beams so loud it covered up the screams
When lover's harmony went oh so wrong

And in every word emotion is torn
And blood flows down the drain
Like she opened up a vein
And cut me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

And now i'm just a prisoner
In that stereo Hi-Fi jail
The needle pierced just like a nail
As she rocks me to the bone
Knocks me to the bone

Do do do do do do do
She rocks me to the bone

Yeah, she rocks me to the bone
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone

Took a walk outside, the truth was on my side,
But I didn't even make the corner.
Revolution in my sights, the time seems so right,
But I never even saw it coming.

Can't you hear me call, bang my head against the wall,
Can't stay around this place forever.
Can't you see, we gotta be free,
We all gotta come together.
Don't let go, oh no.

Unfinished business,
You thought you'd keep me quiet.
You put a bullet in my side, but you can't put out my light.
Unfinished business,
Yes, love's the only way to find peace today.

The future's here today, we gotta find a way,
To put all the pain behind you.
You gotta put down the guns, all religion is one,
Politicians only want to blind you.
Break away, oh there's a way.

Oh, the message is clear, wipe away all the tears,
And build a better world around you.
Got to give out your love to each and every one,
Can't you see it's only fear that holds you,
Let it go.  Oh, let it go.

Unfinished business,
I though that I was right[?].
What that fool put out that night, [?] burn so bright.
Unfinished business,
Oh yes, love's the only way to find peace today.

So you thought you'd take my life,
Put a bullet in my side, but you can't put out my light.
Unfinished business,
Love's the only way to find peace today.
Unfinished business
Unfinished business
Unfinished business

There's a long road behind you,
It's a hard life if you make it one
Come on to the other side [?]
There is no place to hide

Unfinished business

_SOT When I Turn Off The Living Room Light _EOT
 
Who cares if you're Jewish,
And your breath smells of garlic,
And your nose is a shiny red light.
To me you are gorgeous,
And everything's right,
When I turn off the living room light.

Your clothes are old-fashioned,
Your knuckles are bony,
Your hair looks a terrible sight.
But I don't have to see you,
The way that you are,
When I turn off the living room light.
When I turn off the living room light.
I don't have to see you,
The way that you are,
When I turn off the living room light.

Well it's not that you are ugly,
And I'm not being cruel,
It helps me to relax, dear,
It helps to keep me cool.
Now I am not intending,
To make you feel ashamed,
What's wrong in me pretending?
'Cause you can't help being plain.

Your nose may be bulbous,
Your face may be spotty,
Your skin may be wrinkled and tight.
But I don't want to see you,
The way that you are,
So I turn off the living room light.

We don't feel so ugly,
We don't feel so draggy,
We don't feel so twisted up tight.
And we don't feel as ugly as we really are,
When we turn off the living room light.
When we turn off the living room light.
We don't feel as ugly as we really are,
When we turn off the living room light.

_SOT When The Wind Blows (Emergency) _EOT
 
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.

In a part of this once-great city
Stands a child crying out in pity.
Gone is hope in the heart of each hungry hour.

Every year in this land of plenty
There are millions of starving children
What will I say if they look my way?
This is an emergency.

When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.

Bow your heads to the lost generation
Scars so deep, bringing God's damnation.
Businessmen sip wine while congress argue.

But for grace we enjoy our pleasures
What we face will be our salvation
Go build your towns, but remember time will not forget
That this is an emergency.

When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.

Think of what the wise men said.

When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
In my mind I see,
When the wind blows, many leaves will fall.
This is an emergency.

_SOT Where Did My Spring Go? _EOT
 
Where did the spring go?
Where did the trees go?
Where did the sun go?
Where did the bluebirds fly?
Why did the rainbow turn into shadows?

Why am I cold now?
Why does my skin sag?
Why ain't my back straight?
Why do my feet ache?
Where did my youth go?
Where did my life go?

Remember walking in the rain,
And getting soaking wet,
Now I got rheumatic pains,
And I really do regret it.

Where did my teeth go?
Where did my muscles go?
Where did my shoulders go?
Where did my chest go?
When you were loving me,
You were just using me.
You would employ me,
You would destroy me.
Now all I've got are varicose veins.

Where did the spring go?
Where did my hormones go?
Where did my energy go?
Where did my go go?
Where did the pleasure go?
Where did my hair go?

Remember all those sleepless nights,
Making love by candlelight,
And every time you took my love,
You were shortening my life.

Where did my teeth go?
Where did my hair go?
Where did my shoulders go?
Where did my chest go?
Where did my hormones go?
Where did my go go?
Where did my energy go?
Where did my skin go?
Where did my muscles go?
Where did my liver go?
Where did my heart go?
Where did my bones go?

_SOT Yours Truly, Confused N10 _EOT
 
Dear sir or madame, I don't normally write to the press
But the neighbourhood where I grew up is really quite depressed.
Society is crumbling but the media's obsessed with boobs, bums,
Dot com, millionaires, fame, fashion, footsie shares
But people they couldn't care less.

While parliamentary yobbos shout abuse around the house
Do-gooders and reformers lead our nation to defeat.
While murderers and terrorists get compassionate release
You're out now. You're back on the street yeh, back on the street.

That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10.

I close my eyes and lay back and I think of England.
I dream about that green and pleasant land we knew as England.
That throne of kings, that sceptred isle set in a silver sea
Has turned into a laughing stock divided without harmony.

That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10

The burglars have ransacked all the houses in the street
While Mercs and Posches double park with sheer impunity.
When towed away the ponces plead to all and sundry
Referee what about me?

So forgive my lack of confidence and total low esteem
But the dog eat dog society has deemed us all has-beens.
While our smiling bland spin doctors slyly lead us down the track
To a stab in the back.

I'm much too terrified to go out at night but the television's boring.
They're vandalising all the cars on the street
But I won't lay down and take defeat.

That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10

Thank you goodnight
